If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!\n",
            "NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!\n",

            "Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! \"Fuck you.\" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name \"Redskins\", they will immediately think \"titties\" and \"balls\". It's just a bold new way that we can say \"We don't fucking care.\" Go Redskins! \n",

            "What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!\n",

            "Well, somebody did!\n",
            "A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! \n",
            "It is really sweet.\n",
            "Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.\n",
            "You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest \"fuck you\" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. \n",

            "Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!\n",

            "No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!\n",

            "Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! \n",

            "At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!\n",
            "Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!\n",
            "I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. \n",

            "Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.\n",
            "Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?\u00a0\u00a0Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?\n",
            "I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.\n",
            "Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.\n",
            "Butters-\n",
            "Butters. Butters.\n",
            "Butters, I had to!\u00a0\u00a0Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!\n",
            "Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!\n",
            "Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass!\u00a0\n",
            "What?\u00a0\n",
            "What does that have to do with me?\n",
            "Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.\n",
            "You were what?!\n",
            "You were spying on me?!\n",
            "But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!\n",
            "You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that\u00a0not\u00a0spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy!\u00a0\n",
            "Butters.\n",
            "Because, Butters-\n",
            "Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-\u00a0\u00a0Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.\n",
            "Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. \"Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one.\"\n",
            "Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from\u00a0Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!\n",
            "Oh hey Butters. Sup?\n",
            "Dude, what's the matter?\n",
            "Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here.\u00a0\n",

            "Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.\n",
            "Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.\n",
            "Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.\n",
            "Your dad's drone.\n",
            "Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!\n",
            "Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.\n",
            "It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom.\u00a0\n",
            "Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass.\"\n",

            "You're welcome.\u00a0\n",
            "What are you two boners doing?\n",
            "I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.\n",
            "How much money did you micropay today, Stan?\n",
            "Yes.\n",
            "Jimmy told\u00a0me\u00a0about this game.\n",
            "The?!\n",
            "Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!\n",
            "It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!\n",
            "How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.\n",
            "And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!\n",
            "That makes sense.\n",
            "It's done.\u00a0\n",
            "The word is out.\u00a0\u00a0\"Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts.\" I tweeted it.\u00a0\u00a0It's trending.\n",
            "Cool.\n",
            "That's awesome, Butters.\u00a0\u00a0Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now?\u00a0\n",
            "Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-\u00a0\u00a0He's so fucking stupid.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm sure they will soon.\n",
            "Butters, no! Are you crazy?!\n",
            "What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??\n",
            "You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!\n",
            "You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??\n",
            "You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!\n",
            "Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.\u00a0\u00a0Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!\n",
            "Welcome back, dude.\n",
            "How do you feel? Do you feel okay?\n",
            "And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, \"Whoa, I'm back.\"\u00a0\u00a0Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!\n",
            "Come on, guys! This is the\u00a0cure de gars\u00a0of Butters' torture!\n",
            "Thank you, Kyle.\n",
            "Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!\n",
            "Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.\n",
            "Right Butters.\u00a0\u00a0These guys are so dumb, huh?\n",
            "See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.\n",
            "Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?\n",
            "Even 10% is good enough. Here you go.\u00a0\n",
            "Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.\u00a0\u00a0Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?\n",

            "Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.\n",
            "You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.\n",
            "Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.\n",
            "Just take the money, Butters!\u00a0\n",
            "You got the money?\u00a0\u00a0Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.\n",
            "Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.\u00a0\u00a0Are you heading back Butters?\u00a0\u00a0Butters?\u00a0\u00a0Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.\n",
            "Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.\n",
            "Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.\n",
            "Oh shit!\u00a0\u00a0Butters! Butters, where are you now?\n",
            "Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?\n",

            "This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,\u00a0\u00a0but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...\u00a0\u00a0is real.\n",
            "Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality.\u00a0\n",

            "Butters.\n",
            "I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet!\u00a0\n",

            "With what?\n",
            "Fuck you!\n",
            "Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.\n",
            "Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.\n",
            "Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.\n",
            "Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you!\u00a0\n",
            "Are you fucking with me?!\n",
            "Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!\n",
            "Because if you are, it's not cool!\n",
            "Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!\n",
            "Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!\n",
            "That's right!\n",
            "THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?\n",
            "Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER!\u00a0\n",
            "It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool.\u00a0\n",

            "Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?\n",
            "Mmmhmm.\n",
            "And why did the guys send you, Kyle?\n",
            "Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.\n",
            "I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.\n",

            "In virtual reality, yes you did.\n",
            "You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!\n",

            "Dude. NOW this is getting weird!\n",
            "No, you guys. This is virtual reality.\n",

            "I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.\n",
            "I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.\n",
            "You guys!\u00a0\u00a0I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!\n",
            "Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer.\u00a0\n",
            "What's this?\n",

            "Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.\n",
            "This asshole needs to make a move already!\n",
            "He's playing an enchantment.\n",
            "Dude, it was complete brutality!\n",
            "At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!\n",
            "Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!\n",
            "Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.\n",

            "You feel bad for the roosters?\n",
            "Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.\n",

            "What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. \n",

            "What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about \"McNuggets\"?\n",
            "\"Yes I do, you guys.\"  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?\n",
            "All right McNuggets!\n",
            "That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular \"Magic: The Gathering\" look like girls volleyball.\n",

            "You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!\n",

            "Yeah, but I was like \"I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle.\" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?\n",
            "Kyle, this is a private conversation.\n",
            "Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.\n",
            "Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?\n",
            "Who is that? Is that Toby\n",
            "Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?\n",
            "You're what? What, you say?\n",
            "I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!\u00a0\u00a0Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read \"1984\"?\n",
            "See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally!\u00a0\n",
            "That'd be what?\n",
            "I know, right?\u00a0\u00a0A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!\u00a0\u00a0I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?\u00a0\u00a0Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my \"Stop Listening To Me\" Web site.\u00a0\u00a0What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!\u00a0 You guys gonna update your blogs too?\n",
            "Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?\n",
            "Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?\n",
            "Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms.\u00a0\n",
            "Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!\u00a0\u00a0Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school\n",
            "That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle?\u00a0\n",
            "Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.\n",
            "Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, \"you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek.\" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!\u00a0\u00a0This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!\n",
            "Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.\n",
            "No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-\u00a0\u00a0Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.\u00a0\u00a0I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.\u00a0\u00a0Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.\n",
            "What, they already have something better than Twitter?\n",
            "No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?\n",
            "Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.\n",
            "Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.\n",
            "Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?\n",
            "Bill Clinton.\n",
            "Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.\n",
            "I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.\n",
            "I was um, sure that the appointment was today.\n",
            "Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.\n",
            "Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?\n",
            "Really? How big is my file?\n",
            "Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.\n",
            "Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to \"ripped and sweet.\"\u00a0\u00a0'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!\n",
            "Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!\n",
            "The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!\n",
            "Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!\n",
            "I don't know.\n",
            "Get their hands on what?\u00a0\u00a0Dude...\u00a0\n",
            "You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!\u00a0\u00a0I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!\n",
            "You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!\n",
            "It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!\n",
            "Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?!\u00a0\n",
            "It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa!\u00a0\n",
            "I do toooo!\n",
            "Okaaay.\u00a0\u00a0I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.\n",
            "...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?\n",
            "It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.\n",
            "What's this?\n",
            "I can be forgiven?\n",
            "For everything bad I've ever done?\n",
            "And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?\n",
            "Thta's pretty kewl.\n",
            "I do, I love my country!\n",
            "I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!\n",
            "Boooo!\u00a0\u00a0Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!\n",
            "Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.\n",
            "Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!\u00a0\u00a0Boo Wendy! Liar!\n",
            "I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.\n",
            "That's more like it.\n",
            "Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?\n",
            "You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.\n",
            "Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!\n",
            "You guys?\u00a0\u00a0You guys, you'd better get over here.\n",
            "Butters' dad killed his mom.\u00a0\n",
            "Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too!\u00a0\n",
            "And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!\n",
            "Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.\n",
            "Alright, we've gotta do something.\n",
            "Something he said. Did you hear him? He said \"Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!\"\n",
            "You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.\n",
            "Son of a bitch!\u00a0\u00a0Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!\n",
            "Hey Token!  What's up, bro?\n",
            "\"Nothin'\" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?\n",
            "Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?\n",
            "Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. \n",
            "Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? \n",
            "God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. \n",
            "Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong? \n",
            "Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump? \n",
            "It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.\n",
            "He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.\n",
            "But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!\n",
            "No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.\n",
            "M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.\n",
            "M'kay.\n",
            "No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!\n",
            "Hey Token? How are you doing?\n",
            "That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. \n",
            "No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!\n",
            "No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! \n",
            "Agreed.\n",
            "Hoh boy, here we go.\n",
            "Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?\n",
            "This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.\n",
            "I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called \"I Was Not The Bullet.\" \nI was not the bullet. I was not the gun.\nI was not the juror that set the shooter free.\nI was not the trigger. I was not the hate.\nNor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?\nI was not the black family mourning for the dead.\n\"Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?\"\nI was not the verdict.\n",
            "It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.\nI was not the shooter. I was not the gun.\nSo Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.\n",
            "Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.\n",
            "It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.\n",
            "Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! \n",
            "Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say \"I don't blame the white people. No no no!\"\n",
            "Token, calm down.\n",
            "Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! \n",
            "Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Mom it's starting! We've gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! \n",
            "Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!\n",
            "Get to an airport!\n",
            "We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! \n",
            "The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! \n",
            "Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! \n",
            "The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! \n",
            "The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!\n",
            "You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! \n",
            "Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. \n",
            "Everyone quiet! I have to think!\n",
            "I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. \n",
            "Nah! \n",
            "One of them is in the back!\n",
            "Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!\n",
            "It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.\n",
            "His name is Token.\n",
            "I won't do it! He used to be my friend!\n",
            "Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.\n",
            "We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!\n",
            "Come on! \n",
            "Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.\n",
            "A person. \n",
            "Threatening all of us!\n",
            "What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!\n",
            "Stand my ground?\n",
            "Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!\n",
            "This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?\n",
            "The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!\n",
            "Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!\n",
            "If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.\n",
            "Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. \n",
            "I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.\n",
            "Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.\n",
            "Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.\n",
            "Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.\n",
            "Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.\n",
            "Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. \n",
            "That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. \n",
            "Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.\n",
            "Yeah. So bad.\n",
            "Jury found me innocent, Kyle!\n",
            "You interrupt people when they talk.\n",
            "Oh man! \n",
            "Oh boy.\n",
            "Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.\n",
            "Token, calm down.\n",
            "Oh God, here we go again! \n",
            "That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.\n",
            "That sucks, dude.\n",
            "I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.\n",
            "Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.\n",
            "I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.\n",
            "Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?\n",
            "There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. \n",
            "You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!\n",
            "Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! \n",
            "What? What joke? This is real!\n",
            "No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.\n",
            "Thank you, Butters! \n",
            "Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.\n",
            "Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. \n",
            "Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, \"Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it.\"\n",
            "I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. \n",
            "Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?\n",
            "I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.\n",
            "I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said \"No.\" I owe you an apology and, I mean it.\n",
            "No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!\n",
            "But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.\n",
            "You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! \n",
            "Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??\n",
            "Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?\n",
            "Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. \n",
            "Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? \n",
            "Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?\n",
            "You what??\n",
            "Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.\n",
            "Let's see. Oh! Oh! \n",
            "Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?\n",
            "Kyle, are you sure?\n",
            "Well alright. \n",
            "Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?\n",
            "I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?\n",
            "You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? \n",
            "Huh? You comin'? \n",
            "Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. \n",
            "Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?\n",
            "Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.\n",
            "Small penis?!\n",
            "No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.\n",
            "No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.\n",
            "Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? \n",
            "Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.\n",

            "Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick\u00a0. Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.\n",
            "What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we\u00a0can\u00a0get the new gaming system.\n",
            "I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.\n",
            "It\u00a0is\u00a0real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!\n",
            "On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!\u00a0\u00a0...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.\n",
            "Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.\n",
            "They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.\n",

            "But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?\n",
            "Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.\n",
            "Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?\n",

            "What?\n",
            "...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.\n",
            "That's right.\n",
            "We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!\n",
            "Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!\n",
            "Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!\n",

            "Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?\n",
            "Oh my god they're so gaaay!\u00a0\u00a0Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.\n",
            "The Federation has agreed to fight with us!\u00a0\u00a0With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!\u00a0\u00a0You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?\n",
            "You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones\u00a0him by making powerful alliances.\n",
            "Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.\n",
            "What new Elmo doll?\n",
            "Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.\n",
            "I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...\u00a0\u00a0switch sides,\u00a0\u00a0it could make Stan's army problematic for us.\n",
            "True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.\u00a0\u00a0Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.\n",
            "You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?\n",
            "Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!\n",
            "Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!\u00a0\u00a0Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?\n",
            "Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.\n",
            "Alright, stop, stop, stop!\u00a0\u00a0This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot!\u00a0\n",
            "There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training!\u00a0\n",
            "The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.\n",
            "That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!\u00a0\u00a0I said, \"You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!\"\u00a0\n",
            "I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!\u00a0\u00a0Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game.\u00a0\n",
            "Stupid asshole!\u00a0\u00a0Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.\u00a0\u00a0Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!\n",
            "Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick\n",
            "Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.\u00a0\u00a0How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in\u00a0Game of Thrones?\n",
            "Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?\n",
            "So what happens when the dragons show up?\n",
            "Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the\u00a0Game of Thrones\u00a0model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.\n",
            "Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.\n",
            "He's the guy who writes\u00a0Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.\n",
            "Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!\n",
            "Why don't you mind your own business?!\n",
            "Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.\n",
            "It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army\u00a0, but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.\u00a0\u00a0It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...\u00a0\u00a0grounded?\n",
            "That could be up to you.\n",
            "Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.\u00a0\u00a0Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?\n",
            "Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?\u00a0\u00a0Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.\n",
            "Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!\n",
            "Yeah!\n",
            "Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!\n",
            "Hi, is Kenny home?\n",

            "I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?\n",
            "You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.\n",
            "Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!\n",
            "That doesn't even make sense.\n",
            "You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?!\u00a0\n",
            "Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.\n",
            "Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.\u00a0\u00a0But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.\u00a0\u00a0There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.\n",
            "Your CEOs?\n",
            "Uhhh, hmmm. What?\n",
            "Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!\n",
            "He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??\n",
            "Because, because what? Because he's cute?\n",
            "But what does he do besides that he's cute?!\n",
            "Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!\u00a0\u00a0Mom?\u00a0\u00a0Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit.\u00a0\n",
            "He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!\n",
            "So what are you saying, Kyle?!\n",
            "Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?\n",
            "Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.\n",
            "We know a way inside the Red Robin.\u00a0\u00a0You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.\n",
            "Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.\n",
            "Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.\n",
            "I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors.\u00a0\n",
            "Well, think about it.\u00a0\u00a0The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.\n",
            "Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-\n",
            "Dude! Dude!\n",
            "Dude, shut the fuck up!\n",
            "He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.\n",
            "God damn it, shut up!\n",
            "Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what\u00a0Prometheus\u00a0was about while you're at it?!\n",
            "Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see\u00a0Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.\n",
            "Kyle thought of it.\u00a0\u00a0Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!\u00a0\u00a0You're a fuckin' asshole!\n",
            "I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!\n",
            "Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?\n",
            "Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyonc\u00e9.\n",
            "Yesh, kewl.\n",
            "Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.\n",
            "Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?\n",
            "Yes, he did.\n",
            "It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.\n",
            "What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!\n",
            "Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.\u00a0\u00a0And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.\u00a0\u00a0Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.\u00a0\u00a0What have you found out?\n",
            "Oh okay, that could be a while.\u00a0\u00a0All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.\n",
            "Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?\n",
            "What the hell is this?!\n",

            "I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.\n",
            "The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?\n",
            "Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.\u00a0\u00a0We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!\n",
            "Fuck 'em!\n",
            "You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?\n",
            "Uh oh.\n",

            "I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.\n",
            "Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.\n",
            "And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.\n",
            "How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.\n",
            "What d'ja say?\n",
            "Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?\n",
            "Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!\n",
            "Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!\n",
            "You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!\n",
            "You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!\n",
            "-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!\n",
            "No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!\n",
            "I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.\n",
            "Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. \n",
            "Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.\n",
            "Oh, God. That was boring.\n",
            "Well, there is the nice French caf\u00e9 downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.\n",
            "Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.\n",
            "Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?\n",
            "Really? \n",
            "Yes!\n",
            "What's it say, what's it say?\n",
            "What? Let me see that. \n",
            "Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?\n",
            "You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. \n",
            "I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.\n",
            "How is this Kyle? This good? \n",
            "Cool, these will be good uploads.\n",
            "Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?\n",
            "Why don't you make me? \n",
            "Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!\n",
            "I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.\n",
            "Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.\n",
            "Dude, what's going on?\n",
            "Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?\n",
            "Come on, Kyle.\n",
            "It's okay, man, come on.\n",
            "Get a couple facing the other way, brah. \n",
            "I know. I know Kyle. \n",
            "I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. \n",
            "No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.\n",
            "And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. \n",
            "Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?\n",
            "No, kitty, you have to be quiet.\n",
            "No kitty! That's a bad kitty! \n",
            "Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!\n",
            "Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.\n",
            "SHUT UP, KITTY!\n",
            "Let's do this. \n",
            "No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. \n",
            "Alright, football night, what do you do?\nGet out your camera and a boobie or two.\n",
            "We gotta get serious while we\u2019re in our prime.\n",
            "Come on everybody,\nIt's Faith Hilling time.\nDancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?\nThis is the only memeing I'll ever do.\n",
            "Is a meme I will fight\n'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.\n",
            "Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?\n",
            "Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? \n",
            "So interesting, wow. \n",
            "Oh, hey, Kyle.\n",
            "Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.\n",
            "Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?\n",
            "Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.\n",
            "All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  \"Cartman's Passover Holiday Special\", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! \n",
            "Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.\n",
            "Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.\n",
            "Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.\n",
            "It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...\n",
            "Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!\n",
            "Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.\n",
            "Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.\n",
            "I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?\n",
            "Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.\n",
            "Butters.\n",
            "Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.\n",
            "Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.\n",
            "Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.\n",
            "Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.\n",
            "You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.\n",
            "JESUS IS A LIE!\n",
            "Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.\n",
            "Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!\n",
            "No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?\n",
            "Sh! You hear that?\n",
            "I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.\n",
            "It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.\n",
            "I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. \n",
            "We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. \n",
            "That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.\n",
            "Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! \n",
            "Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.\n",
            "People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.\n",
            "These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!\n",
            "I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.\n",
            "It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.\n",
            "Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.\n",
            "Heh. What do you mean? \n",
            "Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?\n",
            "Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.\n",
            "Why?\n",
            "There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?\n",
            "Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? \n",
            "Jesus loves me this I know\n'Cause Republicans tell me so\nLittle ones God will protect\n'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect\nEverything still clear out there?\n",
            "Guys?!\n",
            "Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!\n",
            "What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!\n",
            "It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?\n",
            "Wingstreet?!\n",
            "Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!\n",
            "HUH?!\n",
            "Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!\n",
            "OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?\n",
            "This isn't safe or fun!\n",
            "NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!\n",
            "Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.\n",
            "Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.\n",
            "It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! \n",
            "Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- \n",
            "Ugh... what... where...\n",
            "Ugh... what?  What's going on?\n",
            "It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?\n",
            "So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.\n",
            "Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.\n",
            "What does that mean?\n",
            "Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?\n",
            "You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! \n",
            "Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?\n",
            "But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.\n",
            "Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. \n",
            "But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.\n",
            "I love you, dad.\n",
            "And our love grows\n",
            "Have no fear, for God is near\nAnd God loves all his children\nHuh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?\n",
            "No, Kyle! I don't believe you!\n",
            "Noooo! \n",
            "Noooooo! \n",
            "Noooo! \n",
            "No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! \n",
            "We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! \n",
            "No! No! The bread is all flat! No!\n",
            "I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.\n",
            "Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.\n",
            "I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.\n",
            "Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!\n",
            "Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all \"my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that.\" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.\n",
            "He has a point.\n",
            "I have balls.\n",
            "Still balls.\n",
            "Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!\nYou can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.\n",
            "My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o\n",
            "'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. \n",
            "We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! \n",
            "The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!\n",
            "Somebody help us! \n",
            "Kyle, hurry! \n",
            "Oh God!\n",
            "Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.\n",
            "Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.\n",
            "No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.\n",
            "Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!\n",
            "Ziplining. Hell yeah.\n",
            "We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.\n",
            "Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.\n",
            "Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.\n",
            "Alright!\n",
            "Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. \n",
            "...No.\n",
            "Finally!\n",
            "Well, come on, we don't have a choice. \n",
            "Mmmm, no?\n",
            "The trees' biology?\n",
            "Yeah. \n",

            "We should have never listened to you, Kyle.\n",
            "Yeah you! In the park this morning?! \"I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!\"\n",
            "I brought it up because you already brought it up!\n",
            "Fuck you Kyle!\n",
            "Nnnn-mo...\n",
            "Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! \n",
            "This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.\n",
            "If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!\n",
            "NOOO! \n",

            "Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?\n",
            "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\n",
            "I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!\n",
            "No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!\n",
            "You?!\n",
            "You... You killed Kenny! \n",
            "It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.\n",
            "You came for us!\n",
            "We were saved. It was over.\n",
            "No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.\n",
            "It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. \n",
            "What?\n",
            "Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.\n",

            "Huh?\n",
            "Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? \n",

            "Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?\n",
            "Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?\n",
            "Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.\n",
            "W-yeah, of course. \n",
            "Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?\n",

            "Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?\n",
            "Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?\n",
            "Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.\n",
            "Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.\n",
            "Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. \n",
            "Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.\n",
            "Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.\n",
            "No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.\n",
            "Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! \n",
            "Oh my God, this is sooo cute.\n",
            "Ohhhhh my God.\n",
            "You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. \n",
            "I see the questions in your eyes.\nI know what's weighing on your mind.\nYou can be sure I know, my heart.\nGirl I'll stand beside you through the years\nYou'll only cry those happy tears\nAnd though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart\nI swear by the moon and the stars in the sky\nI'll be there\nI swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)\nI'll be there\nFor better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)\nI'll love you with every black beat of my heart\nAnd I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?\n",
            "Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. \n",
            "I don't know, it's just so... perfect. \n",
            "Kyle, Jesus Christ!\n",
            "Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?\n",
            "Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!\n",
            "Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!\n",
            "Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.\n",
            "Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.\n",
            "Nothing.\n",
            "Nobody.\n",
            "Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!\n",
            "Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! \n",
            "Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!\n",
            "That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!\n",
            "Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.\n",
            "You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! \n",
            "I'm gonna get you! \n",
            "I almost got you! Almost! \n",
            "Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! \n",
            "It's not fair! They were so... happy!\n",
            "It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!\n",
            "No, they won't!\n",
            "No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!\n",
            "And you! I should never have believed in you!\n",
            "I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! \n",
            "That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.\n",
            "Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.\n",
            "Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. \n",
            "Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.\n",
            "Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.\n",
            "Denver Nuggets game?\n",
            "NOOOOOOO! \n",
            "Nooooooo!\n",
            "NOOOOOOO. \n",
            "No time! NOOOOOOO!\n",
            "Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. \n",
            "I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.\nI swear by the moon and the stars in the sky \nI'll be there, Kyle\nI swear  like a shadow that's by your side\nKyle, swear to God I'll be there.\nFor better or worse , till death do us part \nI'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!\n",
            "I swear, Kyle. \n",
            "Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.\n",
            "Oh my gohhhd, so cute! \n",
            "That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.\n",
            "Really?!\n",
            "What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!\n",
            "Hey, stop it!\n",
            "Nooo!\n",
            "That's right, Butters.\n",
            "Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!\n",
            "That's true.\n",
            "Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.\n",
            "Who needs a coach? We have Butters.\n",
            "Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.\n",
            "Hey Butters, you got a minute?\n",
            "I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.\n",
            "No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.\n",
            "...I don't have a dad.\n",
            "Youuu save it all?\n",
            "Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?\n",
            "Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.\n",
            "Holy shit I think I do.\n",
            "That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.\n",
            "That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.\n",
            "Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? \n",
            "I'm not fat, Kyle.\n",
            "Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! \n",
            "See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.\n",
            "Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!\n",
            "Yeah... Yeah, here you go. \n",
            "Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?\n",
            "I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying \"No, I'm big-boned\" or \"no, that's just muscle\"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.\n",
            "No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!\n",
            "Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. \n",
            "Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. \n",
            "Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. \n",
            "Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. \n",
            "That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.\n",
            "Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. \n",
            "Out of the way. Out of the way please. \n",
            "Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!\n",
            "Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.\n",
            "And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?\n",
            "Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. \n",
            "What, Kyle?! \n",
            "You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!\n",
            "Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!\n",
            "Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. \n",
            "It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!\n",
            "Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!\n",
            "What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!\n",
            "I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! \n",
            "You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!\n",
            "I'm pissed!\n",
            "Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!\n",
            "I ain't done with you, bitch!\n",
            "Oh! You fucking bitch! \n",
            "Dude, no way!\n",
            "Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?\n",
            "Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?\n",
            "No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? \"Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight.\" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!\n",
            "Oh no, really?\n",
            "Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!\n",
            "What-what do you mean?\n",
            "Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!\n",
            "Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!\n",
            "Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?\n",
            "Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!\n",
            "Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.\n",
            "Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.\n",
            "Sorry about this.\n",
            "'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean \"That's all right\"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!\n",
            "That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!\n",
            "I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!\n",
            "You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?\n",
            "Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!\n",
            "Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!\n",
            "He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!\n",
            "Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!\n",
            "Who is there?\n",
            "Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?\n",
            "A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!\n",
            "Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!\n",
            "Heh- hello?\n",
            "No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!\n",
            "Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!\n",
            "Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!\n",
            "Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! \n",
            "HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! \n",
            "Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.\n",
            "Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!\n",
            "What?  Hello?\n",
            "Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.\n",
            "Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.\n",
            "No, \"uloveboobs.\" Lower-case u love boobs.\n",
            "My password is uloveboobs!\n",
            "You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!\n",
            "Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.\n",
            "Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.\n",
            "God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? \n",
            "It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. \n",
            "FELLAS! Fellas!\n",
            "You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!\n",
            "It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!\n",
            "Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! \n",
            "Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? \n",
            "...Wow.\n",
            "Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. \n",
            "Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.\n",
            "He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.\n",
            "Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. \n",
            "We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.\n",
            "Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?\n",
            "Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.\n",
            "You'll just have to wait and see.\n",
            "Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!\n",
            "This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!\n",
            "Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, \"Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!\" \n",
            "I'm not Bruce Vilanch!\n",
            "The Incredible...\n",
            "No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!\n",
            "The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!\n",
            "JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! \n",
            "That's right!\n",
            "Dude dude dude! Check it out. \n",
            "You guys, we've gotta stop it!\n",
            "Cartman SMASH! \n",
            "Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.\n",
            "Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?\n",
            "Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!\n",
            "I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.\n",
            "All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! \n",
            "Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!\n",
            "Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?\n",
            "Uh huh.\n",
            "So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a \"What Would Jesus Do\" bracelet!\n",
            "The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!\n",
            "Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!\n",
            "Craig?! You asshole!\n",
            "Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?\n",
            "Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!\n",
            "...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.\n",
            "Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.\n",
            "...Fuck! Dude, weak. \n",
            "Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?\n",
            "MOM!\n",
            "She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.\n",
            "Mom? Where's my mom?\n",
            "\"Warm nuts\", she said.\n",

            "No way dude. No way.\n",
            "MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!\n",
            "Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. \n",
            "MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!\n",
            "Hey Kyle. What's up?\n",
            "Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.\n",
            "Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.\n",
            "You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?\n",
            "Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? \n",
            "What if I did, Kyle?\n",
            "Pretty sweet, huh?\n",
            "What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.\n",
            "No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.\n",
            "Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. \n",
            "Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. \n",
            "Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.\n",
            "Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.\n",
            "Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.\n",
            "Hmmm, no.\n",
            "I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.\n",
            "Ey! You can't do that! Ey!\n",
            "I know my rights! Stop right now! \n",
            "I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.\n",
            "But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. \n",
            "Mm, mhm, mhm.\n",
            "They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.\n",
            "Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?\n",
            "Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.\n",
            "So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.\n",
            "Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. \n",
            "Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?\n",
            "I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.\n",
            "Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.\n",
            "Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!\n",
            "Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!\n",
            "I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!\n",
            "I want a part in the new movies!\n",
            "I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.\n",
            "Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.\n",
            "Haha.\n",
            "Haha. \n",
            "I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! \n",
            "Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?\n",
            "No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! \n"

Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!\n",

            "What?\n",
            "Those weren't our dick sizes?\n",

            "Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.\n",
            "What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.\n",
            "Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!\n",
            "Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!\n",
            "What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!\n",
            "We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. \n",
            "Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.\n",
            "Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.\n",
            "After you. \n",
            "Come on. \n",
            "We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.\n",
            "It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.\n",
            "Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.\n",
            "We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.\n",
            "You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. \n",
            "Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.\n",
            "Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. \n",
            "Betsy MacIntosh?\n",
            "We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?\n",
            "We need to speak with you, ma'am. \n",
            "And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?\n",
            "Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. \n",
            "We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?\n",
            "Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.\n",
            "Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.\n",
            "I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-\n",
            "Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states \"benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being.\" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? \n",
            "It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!\n",
            "Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.\n",
            "Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?\n",
            "They can't make money. It's against the rules.\n",
            "Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.\n",
            "What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!\n",
            "We're a non-profit company, Kyle.\n",
            "Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. \n",
            "It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. \n",
            "Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.\n",
            "A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this \"poutaine\".\n",
            "It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.\n",
            "Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.\n",
            "My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.\n",

            "You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.\n",
            "Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.\n",
            "Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?\n",
            "Uh-huh??\n",
            "Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?\n",
            "Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? \n",
            "Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? \n",
            "Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?\n",
            "Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.\n",
            "See what I mean, you guys? \n",
            "Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?\n",
            "Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!\n",
            "Oh no. Oh NO!\n",
            "Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! \n",
            "You guys have stuffing?!\n",
            "Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!\n",
            "No!\n",
            "NO!\n",
            "Yeah, History Channel rules.\n",
            "Uhhh??\n",
            "Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.\n",
            "Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.\n",
            "Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!\n",
            "Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? \n",
            "Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. \n",
            "This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!\n",
            "Eh yeah?\n",
            "Heh heh, yeah?\n",
            "What?\n",
            "Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.\n",
            "Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!\n",
            "Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!\n",
            "That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! \n",
            "Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.\n",
            "Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?\n",
            "You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!\n",
            "Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!\n",
            "We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!\n",
            "Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!\n",
            "IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! \n",
            "My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.\n",
            "What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.\n",
            "Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "That's right.\n",
            "Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!\n",
            "Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! \n",
            "A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!\n",
            "How?!\n",
            "Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!\n",
            "Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?\n",
            "Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.\n",
            "What??  Greeley?\n",
            "What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!\n",
            "You're my new mom?\n",
            "Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?\n",
            "Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!\n",
            "Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! \n",
            "Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.\n",
            "You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! \n",
            "Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!\n",
            "Really?\n",
            "YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!\nCause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  \nLet's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! \nHis mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!\nGreeley Colorado's the place to be!\nIt's a whole new beginning for you and me!\nLife can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!\nI'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!\n",

            "I was just teasing.\n",
            "My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!\n",
            "Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!\n",

            "There he is, there's my buddy.\n",
            "Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?\nThe day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.\n'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!\nKenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!\nAll that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)\nThat's right, the poor kid in school.\nSing it with me, guys!\nHe's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)\nI'm not-\n",

            "Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.\n",
            "Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.\n",
            "You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.\n",
            "Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.\n",
            "It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?\n",
            "Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.\n",
            "Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.\n",
            "Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?\n",
            "Okay let's, let's try this one.\n",
            "Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?\n",
            "This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.\n",
            "Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...\n",
            "Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!\n",
            "Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...\n",
            "Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.\n",
            "Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.\n",
            "Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!\n",
            "AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!\n",
            "I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.\n",

I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? \n",

            "I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.\n",

            "Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.\n",

            "Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.\n",
            "Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this \"Obama\" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.\n",
            "He's fuckin' gay as hell!\n",
            "So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!\n",
            "Alright, \"start your engine.\" What's that mean?\n",
            "Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!\n",

            "Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. \n",
            "Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.\n",
            "Fuckin' gay as hell. \n",
            "Oh, fuck my ass again! \n",
            "No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.\n",
            "The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!\n",
            "Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!\n",
            "You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.\n",

            "Aw, crap, there's more of them?\n",
            "You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!\n",

            "Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!\n",
            "So what?! That makes you from Jersey!\n",

            "Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!\n",
            "Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.\n",
            "Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!\n",
            "What the hell are you guys doing?!\n",
            "And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!\n",

            "Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!\n",
            "That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!\n",
            "So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, \"I'll smash your teeth in!\" My head is all like gashed open.\n",
            "I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!\n",
            "This is very serious, Butters.\n",
            "Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.\n",
            "Come on, you guys, hurry!\n",
            "I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!\n",
            "Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.\n",
            "Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!\n",
            "Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.\n",
            "Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! \n",
            "Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.\n",
            "Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!\n",
            "You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!\n",
            "Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?\n",

            "No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!\n",

            "Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.\n",

            "Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!\n",
            "Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?\n",
            "Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.\n",
            "Purity ring?\n",
            "Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!\n",

            "\"Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings.\" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! \n",
            "Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!\n",
            "This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh \n",

            "I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.\n",

            "The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. \n",
            "Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.\n",
            "I know, right?  \"Who is the Coon?\" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.\n",
            "You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!\n",
            "He's not a fag!\n",
            "Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term \"fag,\" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?\n",
            "And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... \"Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?\" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.\n",
            "Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.\n",

It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...\n",

            "All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.\n",

            "What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?\n",
            "Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?\n",
            "Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?\n",
            "What are you?\n",
            "And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.\n",
            "Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.\n",
            "Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.\n",
            "Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! \n",
            "Motherfucker!\n",
            "Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!\n",
            "Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!\n",
            "But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!\n",
            "What?!\n",
            "Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?\n",
            "Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?\n",
            "Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.\n",
            "Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! \n",
            "Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.\n",
            "It's cool man, it's cool. \n",
            "Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?\n",
            "It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. \n",
            "You do?\n",
            "But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?\n",
            "Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?\n",
            "That's cool. You wanna write some together? \n",
            "Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks\n",
            "Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... \"Do you like fishsticks?\"\n",
            "So then I can say, \"What are you, a gay fish?\"\n",
            "It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! \n",
            "Thanks you guys!\n",
            "Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.\n",
            "Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.\n",
            "Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.\n",
            "Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. \n",
            "Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.\n",
            "Uhhh excuse me? \n",
            "Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.\n",
            "Yeah, that was kewl huh?\n",
            "Whassat?\n",
            "So... here it is.\n",
            "That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!\n",
            "Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!\n",
            "Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!\n",
            "Hello Jim.\n",
            "What are you up to?\n",
            "Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. \n",
            "Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.\n",
            "Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, \"Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?\" \n",
            "Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! \n",
            "Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  \"Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?\" There! \n",
            "Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.\n",
            "You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.\n",
            "Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.\n",
            "All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.\n",
            "I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.\n",
            "You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!\n",
            "Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.\n",
            "North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.\n",
            "I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.\n",
            "Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.\n",
            "Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.\n",
            "Then why don't you wanna go?\n",
            "That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! \n",

            "Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!\n",
            "Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?\n",
            "The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.\n",
            "Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! \n",
            "Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. \n",
            "Avast!  These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.\n",

            "Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.\n",
            "Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. \n",

            "Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.  Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!\n",
            "Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!\n",

            "Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!\n",
            "Right?\n",
            "No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.\n",

            "Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?\n",
            "Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?\n",
            "Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.\n",
            "But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!\n",
            "You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?\n",
            "Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!\n",
            "Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!\n",
            "You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!\n",
            "Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!\n",
            "Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' \"Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.\"  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.\n",
            "- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -\n",
            "Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.\n",
            "Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.\n",
            "I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.\n",
            "\"Thank you\" and this is to..?\n",
            "\"To Douglas.\" There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.\n",
            "Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?\n",
            "Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.\n",
            "That'll be five dollars.\n",
            "A book signing.\n",
            "I do not directly say she's a slut!\n",
            "You didn't read the rest, dude.\n",
            "\"Or does she?\" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!\n",
            "You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?\n",
            "Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?\n",
            "And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!\n",
            "Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!\n",
            "Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! \n",
            "Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. \n",
            "The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.\n",
            "Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.\n",
            "And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?\n",
            "Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.\n",
            "People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.\n",
            "Of course. That's why we're here.\n",
            "Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.\n",
            "Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.\n",
            "How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? \n",
            "You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.\n",
            "Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?\n",
            "If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? \n",
            "You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?\n",
            "Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?\n",
            "What? What do you mean I know that?\n",
            "No! You wiped them all out!\n",
            "Wait, hold on, can we take a break?\n",
            "Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-\n",
            "No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!\n",
            "You sold the movie rights to who?!\n",
            "Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!\n",
            "Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! \n",
            "Huh!\n",
            "No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!\n",

            "I am here... to teach you calculuuus.\n",
            "Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.\n",
            "Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge\n",
            "How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.\n",
            "No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.\n",
            "Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?\n",
            "Nice form, compadre. \n",
            "Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? \n",
            "Okay, you start on defense, amigo. \n",
            "Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!\n",
            "What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. \n",
            "Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. \n",
            "Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?\n",
            "Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- \n",
            "Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: \"I mis-interpreted the rules.\" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! \"I mis-interpreted the rules.\" Say it with me.\n",
            "Good. Again.\n",
            "Again!\n",
            "Now you sound like white people!\n",
            "The answer to #27 is 5.\n",
            "The answer to #28 is 14.\n",
            "All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?\n",
            "How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.\n",
            "Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?\n",
            "Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.\n",
            "Mexicans are told not to cheat. \"Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child.\" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.\n",
            "Uh what?\n",
            "Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.\n",
            "How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, \"Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat.\" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.\n",
            "You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.\n",
            "I reeached these keeeds.\n",
            "Let's be partners, Kenny.\n",
            "Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. \n",
            "Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.\n",
            "Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?\n",
            "God damn it!\n",
            "That isn't necessary!\n",
            "You can let go now, Butters.\n",
            "Butters, come on!\n",
            "I wanna shoot an Indian.\n",
            "Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  \"Super... Phun Thyme.\"  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!\n",
            "Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!\n",
            "Fine, then let go of my hand!\n",
            "Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!\n",
            "Fine, then you're comin' with me!\n",
            "Butters, let go God-damn it!\n",
            "Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!\n",
            "All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.\n",
            "Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?\n",
            "Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! \n",
            "Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!\n",
            "Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. \n",
            "Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!\n",
            "Yeheah, we're wired up!\n",
            "Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! \n",
            "Aw, just a few more things.\n",
            "Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. \n",
            "Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.\n",
            "Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.\n",
            "Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.\n",
            "They must have realized we left. Damn.\n",
            "Shhh! Butters!\n",
            "Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!\n",
            "Butters, l-listen to me, listen.\n",
            "All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.\n",
            "If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.\n",
            "Butters?\n",
            "All right, come on! \n",
            "Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.\n",
            "Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.\n",
            "It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.\n",
            "Save me!\n",
            "... Oh dude, laaame.\n",
            "Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!\n",
            "Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!\n",
            "Ready? Go! \n",
            "Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?\n",
            "Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.\n",
            "Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.\n",
            "What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.\n",
            "Butters.\n",
            "Jesus Christ! \n",
            "AAAAH! \n",
            "No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!\n",
            "They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!\n",
            "Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.\n",
            "They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.\n",
            "All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?\n",
            "There you are, Butters!\n",
            "Butters, I need your help.\n",
            "The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!\n",
            "I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.\n",
            "You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!\n",
            "Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?\n",
            "So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!\n",
            "You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.\n",
            "All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?\n",
            "This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. \n",
            "Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say \"herro\" and \"prease\" a lot.  \"Oh, herro prease.\" Ping pong ching chong.\n",
            "Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!\n",
            "It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!\n",
            "Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.\n",
            "Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?\n",
            "Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.\n",
            "They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.\n",
            "So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.\n",
            "Ting ton teetong.\n",
            "Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. \n",
            "All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!\n",
            "Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.\n",
            "What day is American invasion again? I fohget. \n",
            "...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.\n",
            "Oh my God...\n",
            "Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. \n",
            "Hold the gun on them Butters!\n",
            "They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!\n",
            "Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!\n",
            "Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!\n",
            "Shoot him, Butters!\n",
            "You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!\n",
            "Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.\n",
            "That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.\n",
            "It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.\n",
            "Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! \n",
            "No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!\n",
            "One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!\n",
            "No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! \n",
            "Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!\n",
            "God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!\n",
            "What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!\n",
            "...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!\n",
            "No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!\n",
            "Good! Did you kill him? \n",
            "Dude...\n",
            "Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. \n",
            "You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.\n",
            "I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.\n",
            "I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. \n",
            "She said it again. \n",
            "Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?\n",
            "Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!\n",
            "I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.\n",
            "Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!\n",
            "Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  \"Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!\" \n",
            "Not at all.  \"Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!\"\n",
            "Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?\n",
            "Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?\n",
            "You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.\n",
            "Whassup?  Whassup?\n",
            "Standing right here, let's go, bitch.\n",
            "You're gonna fight me after school?\n",
            "You're a chick, dude.\n",
            "Oh, it's on, bitch!\n",
            "She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.\n",
            "Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. \n",
            "Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?\n",
            "Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-\n",
            "I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.\n",
            "Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.\n",
            "Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.\n",
            "Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.\n",
            "Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.\n",
            "Wendy. Wendy psst.\n",
            "Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.\n",
            "Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-\n",
            "Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.\n",
            "My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.\n",
            "Eat my underwear?\n",
            "Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.\n",
            "No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.\n",
            "I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.\n",
            "I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... \n",
            "Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.\n",
            "So...  are we cool?\n",
            "I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-\n",
            "Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?\n",
            "Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.\n",
            "You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.\n",
            "Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.\n",
            "Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.\n",
            "You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said \"Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone.\" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.\n",
            "God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! \n",
            "Detention! That's it! \n",
            "Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? \n",
            "Ahhh, sweet.\n",
            "What?! That's ridiculous!\n",
            "That's not why I did it.\n",
            "Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.\n",
            "Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.\n",
            "Huh?\n",
            "The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. \n",
            "The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. \n",
            "Okay Mommy. Mamamama.\n",
            "Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.\n",

            "That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. \n",

            "Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! \n",

            "You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!\n",
            "Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!\n",

            "Why... why does that matter?\n",

            "It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.\n",
            "No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!\n",
            "Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!\n",
            "I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!\n",
            "That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!\n",
            "I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.\n",
            "Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.\n",
            "Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.\n",
            "Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.\n",
            "But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. \n",
            "But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. \n",
            "You, you will?\n",
            "It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! \n",
            "What?\n",
            "Mom, she's lying!\n",
            "Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!\n",
            "Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie\n",
            "Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!\n",
            "HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call \"Moods of Winter\" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?\n",
            "And now this next picture \n",
            "And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. \n",
            "Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.\n",
            "What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-\n",
            "...Lame.\n",
            "Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.\n",
            "Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.\n",
            "They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. \n",
            "This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.\n",
            "Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?\n",
            "Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?\n",
            "Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?\n",
            "That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!\n",
            "All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! \n",
            "Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!\n",
            "Me?!\n",
            "I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!\n",
            "That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. \n",
            "And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! \n",
            "There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! \n",
            "All right, lock that door, Craig! \n",
            "I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.\n",
            "This is a scientific test, designed to-\n",
            "I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!\n",
            "If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!\n",
            "Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.\n",
            "All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. \n",
            "Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. \n",
            "It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! \n",
            "Kenny!\n",
            "Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! \n",
            "He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! \n",
            "What, Clyde?\n",
            "All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!\n",
            "Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!\n",
            "Guilty! I thought so! \n",
            "All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! \n",
            "Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!\n",
            "Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!\n",
            "But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! \n",
            "Uh oh! \n",
            "Duhude, dude,  not cool!\n",
            "Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.\n",
            "What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?\n",
            "No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.\n",
            "Kyle, are you on your computer?\n",
            "Get online. I need you to check something for me.\n",
            "Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!\n",
            "Get online now!\n",
            "Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.\n",
            "Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?\n",
            "Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?\n",
            "That's funny.\n",
            "He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.\n",
            "The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.\n",
            "Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! \n",
            "I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!\n",
            "If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?\n",
            "Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.\n",
            "Yeah. \n",
            "Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!\n",
            "Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!\n",
            "Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!\n",
            "Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!\n",
            "What?\n",
            "Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!\n",
            "He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!\n",
            "I said I will only talk to the President!\n",
            "LALALALALALALALA!\n",
            "LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!\n",
            "President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?\n",
            "Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!\n",
            "Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!\n",
            "Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?\n",
            "Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?\n",
            "It's my balls! \n",
            "Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.\n",
            "Yeah? \n",
            "Yes, Mr. Thompson?\n",
            "Why? Did you find something?\n",
            "A snuke?\n",
            "I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?\n",
            "Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. \n",
            "Big surprise!\n",
            "Let me have time with him.\n",
            "We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!\n",
            "Where is the detonator?!\n",
            "I can do this aaall day.\n",
            "You can make it stop!\n",
            "Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!\n",
            "Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. \n",
            "Where is your son?!\n",
            "Answer it! \n",
            "Butters.\n",
            "We got him! I know where he is!\n",
            "No no, he's my lead. \n",
            "You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! \n",
            "Uuugh! \n",
            "Where is the detonator!\n",
            "You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!\n",
            "Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! \n",
            "Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.\n",
            "Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!\n",
            "That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.\n",
            "Uhh yes, of course?\n",
            "The Russians?\n",
            "The Germans?\n",
            "The Germans again?\n",
            "You can't possible mean...?\n",
            "Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.\n",
            "Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.\n",
            "But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?\n",
            "Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.\n",
            "Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!\n",
            "Yes or no, Kyle?!\n",
            "But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? \n",
            "Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.\n",
            "And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!\n",
            "Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!\n",
            "Bye, Easter bunny! \n",
            "Have you lost your mind?\n",
            "You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.\n",
            "No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.\n",

            "Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!\n",
            "No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.\n",
            "Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.\n",
            "Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?\n",
            "All right, here we go! Jimmy? \n",
            "Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!\n",
            "There's a bunch outside my house too.\n",

            "Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!\n",
            "You what?!\n",
            "Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!\n",
            "You see what you did, Kyle?!\n",
            "They're everywhere!\n",
            "Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.\n",
            "Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.\n",
            "All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.\n",
            "I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.\n",

            "Cool.\n",
            "Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.\n",

            "Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.\n",
            "Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?\n",
            "Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.\n",
            "Then the game is on, Kyle.\n",
            "Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? \"Big titties! Buttmunch!\" There's no walls anymore! \"Shit!\" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. \"I wet my bed last night.\" \n",
            "Uhh nuh-nothing...\n",
            "Hm. That was... weird.\n",
            "Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. \n",
            "And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?\n",
            "No hey ut what, what I meant to say was \"asslicker cumballs.\" And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! \n",
            "Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! \n",
            "Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?\n",
            "Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! \n",
            "I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! \n",
            "Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!\n",
            "No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.\n",
            "Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! \n",
            "Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.\n",
            "My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.\n",
            "No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.\n",
            "But I'm not gonna do the-\n",
            "I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?\n",
            "You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.\n",
            "No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. \n",
            "Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!\n",
            "No, I'm just gonna go- \n",
            "How does he do that?\n",
            "Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like \"I touched penises with my cousin!\"  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.\n",
            "Kyle?\n",
            "Kyle, what are you doing?\n",
            "Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!\n",
            "I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!\n",
            "You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! \n",
            "All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. \n",
            "It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?\n",
            "Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. \n",
            "O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?\n",
            "Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! \n",
            "Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. \n",
            "Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!\n",
            "Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.\n",
            "It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!\n",
            "Set off diversion track C! \n",
            "Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! \n",
            "Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!\n",
            "Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! \n",
            "Kyle, suck my balls. \n",
            "Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?\n",
            "Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.\n",
            "Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.\n",
            "We had a deal, Kyle!\n",
            "You signed an agreement, Kyle!!\n",
            "Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.\n",
            "And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!\n",
            "I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!\n",
            "Yesss!\n",
            "Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.\n",
            "Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.\n",
            "He has to. He's been ordered by the court.\n",
            "What? Move aside, move aside! \n",
            "Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.\n",
            "Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! \n",
            "Hey, let go of him! \n",
            "No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! \n",
            "Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.\n",
            "I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. \n",
            "Previously on Battlestar Galactica \n",
            "Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. \"Time to pay up, Kyle.\"  But then...  \"NO! NOOO!\"  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. \n",
            "NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.\n",
            "Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!\n",
            "Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!\n",
            "Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!\n",
            "That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!\n",
            "No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!\n",
            "Theee conference room is which way? \n",
            "Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.\n",
            "Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.\n",
            "Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.\n",
            "Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. \n",
            "Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...\n",
            "I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?\n",
            "No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?\n",
            "In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- \n",
            "Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.\n",
            "No! Goddammit no!\n",
            "No! Kyle can't die. \n",
            "Kyle?\n",
            "NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!\n",
            "Zap him again!  Do it!\n",
            "DO IT!  Come on buddy.\n",
            "Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. \n",
            "Wake up, Kyle. \n",
            "Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?\n",
            "What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.\n",
            "You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see\n",
            "Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!\n",
            "Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?\n",
            "Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. \n",
            "Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split\n",
            "How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?\n",
            "...What?\n",
            "Where are you going?!\n",
            "Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.\n",
            "We had a DEAL KYLE!\n",
            "IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!\n",
            "What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!\n",
            "You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?\n",
            "Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?\n",
            "No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!\n",
            "Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!\n",
            "Kyle?\n",
            "So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. \n",
            "You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? \n",
            "O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! \n",
            "O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?\n",
            "No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.\n",
            "Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. \n",
            "Stan, you guys are good! \n",
            "Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.\n",
            "Real guitars are for old people.\n",
            "Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!\n",
            "Oh my God this is so awesome.\n",
            "All right, Stan, you've got it, man!\n",
            "Come on guys. Let's get out of here. \n",

            "What?\n",
            "Butters, you wanna play me next? \n",
            "They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?\n",
            "Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.\n",
            "Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!\n",
            "No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor\n",
            "Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.\n",
            "All right, Bebe, let's see the list.\n",
            "You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!\n",
            "Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.\n",
            "Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!\n",
            "Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.\n",
            "All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call \"Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail\" \n",
            "At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.\n",
            "Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?\n",
            "Bail, bail! \n",
            "Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.\n",
            "Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call \"Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time.\" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.\n",
            "Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! \n",
            "We got it! We got it! \n",

            "I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!\n",
            "Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?\n",
            "Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. \n"

Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.\n",

            "Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?\n",
            "All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. \n",
            "Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. \n",
            "Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. \n",
            "Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.\n",

            "Are you set?\n",
            "All right, let's roll! \n",
            "Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.\n",
            "It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.\n",
            "Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.\n",
            "Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! \n",
            "Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, \"Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?\" \"Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.\"  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!\n",
            "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!\n",
            "Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! \n",

            "Kyle, stop it!\n",
            "So long, Kyle!\n",
            "Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.\n",
            "It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!\n",
            "Dude, can I go before you?\n",
            "So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?\n",
            "So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?\n",
            "Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.\n",
            "Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.\n",
            "...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.\n",
            "This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.\n",
            "Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?\n",
            "Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.\n",
            "Seeya.\n",
            "Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...\n",
            "You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..\n",
            "I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.\n",
            "Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.\n",
            "I I said \"thank you.\" Thank you for listening. \n",
            "It won't take long, sir.  Ow...\n",
            "Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.\n",
            "Wha?  What are they?\n",
            "Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.\n",
            "Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!\n",
            "Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-\n",
            "Why not?\n",
            "Son of a bitch.\n",
            "Well well well! \n",
            "Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.\n",
            "You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.\n",
            "Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.\n",
            "Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.\n",
            "Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.\n",
            "I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!\n",
            "Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon fr\u00e8re!\n",
            "How the hell did you get out?\n",
            "Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!\n",
            "You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!\n",
            "I can't let you do that!\n",
            "Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!\n",
            "Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! \n",
            "Stop it!\n",
            "Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!\n",
            "Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!\n",
            "Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. \n",
            "Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!\n",
            "No! Think about the people who could get hurt!\n",
            "Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!\n",
            "Shut up, Kyle!\n",
            "Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!\n",
            "No gay speeches, Kyle!\n",
            "No! No, I hate Family Guy!! \n",
            "Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.\n",
            "Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!\n",
            "All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. \n",
            "Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! \n",
            "Dude, what are you doing?\n",
            "No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.\n",
            "Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?\n",
            "Ah I don't think so, dude. \n",
            "You... have that kind of power?\n",
            "Somebody get us some help down hyah!\n",
            "Hello??\n",
            "You'd better get us out of here, asshole!\n",
            "You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!\n",
            "This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! \n",
            "No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.\n",
            "I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! \n",
            "You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. \n",
            "I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.\n",
            "No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.\n",
            "That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.\n",
            "I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.\n",
            "All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. \n",
            "Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?\n",
            "Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?\n",
            "Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. \n",
            "All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. \n",
            "Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.\n",
            "I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.\n",
            "NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. \n",
            "Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. \n",
            "You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! \n",
            "Yes you do! \n",
            "No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!\n",
            "Grab my hand.\n",
            "I can't kick!\n",
            "I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!\n",
            "No, you just have to save me. \n",
            "No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.\n",
            "Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! \n",
            "It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!\n",
            "That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?\n",
            "Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!\n",
            "Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!\n",
            "Eh! \n",
            "I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.\n",
            "Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.\n",
            "Well he called me chubby!\n",
            "Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!\n",
            "Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!\n",
            "Mom, I need another energy drink! \n",
            "Wir m\u00fcssen die Juden ausrotten!! \n",
            "Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!\n",
            "Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. \n",
            "Mom, I want a Twinkie.\n",
            "Ha! Hahahahahaha\n",
            "No thanks, I'd rather naught.\n",
            "The hell do you think you're doing?\n",
            "Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!\n",
            "Time out?\n",
            "And what exactly keeps me on the stool?\n",
            "Whoa, how did I do that? \n",
            "Ummm, no?\n",
            "All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.\n",
            "I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.\n",
            "Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.\n",
            "Because you took my Xbox.\n",
            "Well, yeah.\n",
            "Yeah. I guess so.\n",
            "Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.\n",
            "Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?\n",
            "Why not?\n",
            "You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.\n",
            "Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! \n",
            "You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.\n",
            "Not interested I'm me?\n",
            "Yeah, well I don't see why-\n",
            "Hey!\n",
            "Mom, this guy doesn't-\n",
            "Ah! Quit it!\n",
            "Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-\n",
            "KNOCK IT OFF!\n",
            "I'm not fat!\n",
            "Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?\n",
            "Mom, this is degrading!\n",
            "Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! \n",
            "Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.\n",
            "Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!\n",
            "Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?\n",
            "Mom!\n",
            "God dammit stop ignoring me!\n",
            "This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!\n",
            "Quit it, mom!\n",
            "Ooo, Colonel?\n",
            "Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.\n",
            "Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!\n",
            "Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!\n",
            "Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!\n",
            "Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?\n",
            "Suck my asshole, taco vendor!\n",
            "Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!\n",
            "You can't do that to me, I-\n",
            "Goddamnit, you just can't-\n",
            "Seriously! Ey? Eh... \n",
            "Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!\n",
            "Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.\n",
            "Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!\n",
            "All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.\n",
            "Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.\n",
            "Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! \n",
            "Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.\n",
            "You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.\n",
            "Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.\n",
            "...Should that really matter at a time like this?\n",
            "This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.\n",
            "All right, I'm back.\n",
            "Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.\n",
            "That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.\n",
            "Aw, Goddammit!\n",
            "What is he still doing here?!\n",
            "What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!\n",
            "Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! \n",
            "Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!\n",
            "I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-\n",
            "Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-\n",
            "Seriously! Mom-\n",
            "Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?\n",
            "Mom?!\n",
            "Mom? Mom...\n",
            "Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?\n",
            "Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.\n",
            "She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.\n",
            "Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.\n",
            "She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.\n",
            "Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.\n",
            "Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!\n",
            "Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.\n",
            "Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!\n",
            "You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. \n",
            "No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!\n",
            "She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.\n",
            "Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...\n",
            "Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. \n",
            "Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.\n",
            "Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.\n",
            "Tha... thank you?\n",
            "'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. \n",
            "I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. \n",
            "No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.\n",
            "Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?\n",
            "Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?\n",
            "Okay, I'm back.\n",
            "Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!\n",
            "Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!\n",
            "Heheh, totally, heheh.\n",
            "Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!\n",
            "Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.\n",
            "Get out of here, asshole!\n",
            "Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! \n",
            "That sonofabitch!\n",
            "He's a God damned butthole!\n",
            "My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.\n",
            "We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.\n",
            "Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?\n",
            "When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?\n",
            "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?\n",
            "All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!\n",
            "Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!\n",
            "Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.\n",
            "All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.\n",
            "The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.\n",

            "Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.\n",

            "Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?\n",
            "They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.\n",
            "Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!\n",
            "Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?\n",
            "...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! \n",
            "Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?\n",
            "Aha! Do you see?\n",
            "I rest my case.\n",
            "That's right, Butters.\n",
            "What? People see the truth?\n",
            "You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! \n",
            "It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?\n",
            "Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!\n",
            "For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! \n",
            "We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?\n",
            "So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!\n",
            "Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.\n",
            "And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, \"Do you smell lemon grass?\", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.\n",

            "Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.\n",
            "What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.\n",

            "No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea\n",
            "All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?\n",

            "Come on! Come on!\n",

            "Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?\n",
            "Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies. \n",
            "These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.\n",
            "Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. \n",
            "Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.\n",
            "Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! \n",
            "God damn hippie! \n",
            "Get out of here!\n",
            "Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!\n",

            "Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! \n",
            "What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!\n",
            "Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.\n",
            "And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! \n",
            "Please, I have to talk to you all right now!\n",
            "Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!\n",
            "I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.\n",
            "It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. \n",
            "I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!\n",
            "It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '\n",
            "What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! \n",
            "I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!\n",
            "Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!\n",
            "Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. \n",
            "Everybody get in a single-file line!\n",
            "Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.\n",
            "What?\n",
            "You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!\n",
            "No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! \n",
            "What did I do?!\n",
            "They're not people, they're HIPPIES!\n",
            "Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!\n",
            "You... You what?\n",
            "They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!\n",
            "You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! \n",
            "How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!\n",
            "Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.\n",
            "Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.\n",
            "Forget it. \n",
            "It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!\n",
            "Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.\n",
            "I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.\n",
            "Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!\n",
            "All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! \n",
            "All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.\n",
            "In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.\n",
            "We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.\n",
            "Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.\n",
            "All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about- \n",
            "There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.\n",
            "I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. \n",

            "Navigation systems?\n",

            "Come on, come on!\n",

            "Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.\n",
            "Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!\n",
            "Of course he sings. He's black.\n",
            "You wanna know what it is, guys?\n",
            "That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.\n",
            "Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.\n",
            "So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!\n",
            "We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. \n",
            "Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.\n",
            "Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.\n",
            "Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.\n",
            "Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!\n",
            "Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.\n",
            "Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.\n",
            "This will only take a second.\n",
            "Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.\n",
            "Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, \"Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?\" Right?\n",
            "Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.\n",
            "I'll I'll call you back, Abe. \n",
            "I'm making it look like important people call us.\n",
            "...well Token doesn't know that.\n",
            "How?!\n",
            "Jew! \n",
            "Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?\n",
            "Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? \n",
            "From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.\n",
            "We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.\n",
            "Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...\n",
            "Sweet!\n",
            "You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.\n",
            "Token, you signed with us!\n",
            "What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!\n",
            "...Oooo...\n",
            "...Goddamnit! \n",
            "This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! \n",
            "You've ...already done all the work?\n",
            "We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. \n",
            "Excuse us!\n",
            "Dude, how long is the wait?\n",
            "Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.\n",
            "Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.\n",
            "Stupid assholes! \n",
            "Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?\n",
            "Come on, Wing!\n",
            "She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. \n",
            "Gay.\n",
            "Your gift of hope is a great deduction. \n",
            "Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. \n",
            "Four thousand dollars? \n",
            "That's four hundred for us! We did it! \n",
            "Who let the dogs out?\n",
            "Who let the dogs out?\n",
            "Who let-?\n",
            "Naw, sh-she was with you!\n",
            "Wing? Wing?\n",
            "Wing? Here, Wing!\n",
            "Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.\n",
            "Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!\n",
            "Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.\n",
            "Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. \n",

            "Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!\n",
            "Did so!\n",
            "Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! \n",

            "Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. \n",
            "Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. \n",
            "Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?\n",
            "Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!\n",
            "No! No!!\n",
            "Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? \n",
            "Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.\n",
            "What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!\n",
            "...What did you say?\n",
            "Butters...  Butters! You can see me??\n",
            "Oh my God, and you can hear me??\n",
            "Because, Butters, I'm... dead. \n",
            "Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!\n",
            "I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.\n",
            "I don't know, but you're the only one who can.\n",
            "Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!\n",
            "Butters...\n",
            "Butters, you have to help me!\n",
            "All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. \n",
            "Butters.\n",
            "Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!\n",
            "Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.\n",
            "What do you mean?\n",
            "I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!\n",
            "Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.\n",
            "This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! \n",
            "Tell her, tell her that I love her.\n",
            "Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!\n",
            "It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!\n",
            "Just the good times.\n",
            "I can't! Don't you understand?!\n",
            "God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!\n",
            "All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. \n",
            "Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.\n",
            "Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.\n",
            "Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.\n",
            "G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! \n",
            "Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?\n",
            "What else do I have to do?!\n",
            "Atone?\n",
            "Not really...\n",
            "Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.\n",
            "I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.\n",
            "Really?\n",
            "I know how.\n",
            "Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.\n",
            "Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!\n",
            "I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?\n",
            "Butters.\n",
            "Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.\n",
            "I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!\n",
            "She's gonna close soon! Come on! \n",
            "I told you, Butters. \n",
            "Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!\n",
            "All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.\n",
            "Don't worry. I have a plan. \n",
            "They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. \n",
            "Yes, it's working! \n",
            "Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.\n",
            "My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.\n",
            "We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.\n",
            "Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! \n",
            "You sonofabitch Butters!\n",
            "You told me I was a ghost!\n",
            "How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK! \n",
            "Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!\n",
            "No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. \n",
            "Up yours, Butters.\n",
            "Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?\n",
            "Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.\n",
            "Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.\n",
            "I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.\n",
            "Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.\n",
            "Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.\n",
            "Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, \"Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.\"\n",
            "All right, when she stops yappin' again, say \"Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.\"\n",
            "All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with \"Wow, how insightful.\"\n",
            "Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.\n",
            "Aaagh!\n",
            "D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say \"That's the bad guy!\" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!\n",
            "Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.\n",
            "You know how?\n",
            "Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.\n",
            "Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.\n",
            "Awesome.\n",
            "We're not moving.\n",
            "Maybe you have the parking brake on.\n",
            "Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!\n",
            "Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!! \n",
            "Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!\n",
            "I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.\n",
            "Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! \n",
            "Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! \n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "Shyeah, that was pretty funny.\n",
            "Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!\n",
            "Well they should've gotten out of there!\n",
            "We did!\n",
            "Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!\n",
            "Hngh, totally.\n",
            "Aw crap!\n",
            "Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!\n",
            "Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!\n",
            "Why?\n",
            "Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  \"Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility.\"\n",
            "Help! Help! \n",
            "Not so fast, Kyle.\n",
            "Hand over the gold!\n",
            "You know what I'm talkng about!\n",
            "All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!\n",
            "I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!\n",
            "Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!\n",
            "I want... your Jew gold! \n",
            "Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! \n",
            "Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! \n",
            "...Aw man.\n",
            "Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.\n",
            "Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.\n",
            "What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.\n",
            "Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.\n",
            "Video playback initialized. \n",
            "Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.\n",
            "How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?\n",
            "Good man. Any luck here?\n",
            "Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.\n",
            "Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?\n",
            "Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.\n",
            "No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.\n",
            "No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!\n",
            "Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.\n",
            "Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. \n",
            "Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. \n",
            "Okay. One! Two! \n",
            "Nice.\n",
            "Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. \n",
            "Dude, they totally think he's a girl. \n",
            "Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. \n",
            "Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.\n",
            "Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.\n",
            "God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.\n",
            "That son of a bitch!\n",
            "Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!\n",
            "You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.\n",
            "Working on what?! Your dance moves?!\n",
            "Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! \n",
            "Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! \n",
            "Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! \n",
            "Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. \n",
            "No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.\n",
            "Because I do, Clyde.\n",
            "I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?\n",
            "Will you all shut up so I can do this!?\n",
            "Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?\n",
            "Think of the power!\n",
            "Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.\n",
            "Damn, Ken.\n",
            "I broke the egg.\n",
            "I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.\n",
            "...No.\n",
            "No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.\n",
            "Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!\n",
            "Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.\n",
            "...Why are you doing this?\n",
            "What do you want from me?\n",
            "...No.\n",
            "Yes teacher.\n",
            "Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled \"Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.\"  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.\n",
            "Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.\n",
            "I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called \"daywalkers.\" \n",
            "Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...\n",
            "Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. \n",
            "Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! \n",
            "-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille \nFour hungry children and a-\n",
            "I'M GINGER!\n",
            "Help me! Hellp mee!\n",
            "And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!\n",
            "So I'm gonna stay like this forever?\n",
            "Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!\n",
            "Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?\n",
            "Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.\n",
            "Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.\n",
            "Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.\n",
            "What do you mean, Kyle?\n",
            "Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. \n",
            "That's fine, just get it out of the way...\n",
            "Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? \n",
            "I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?\n",
            "Huh?\n",
            "But... it's me.\n",
            "Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. \n",
            "I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!\n",
            "Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us \"genetically inferior.\" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!\n",
            "...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...\n",
            "Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...\n",
            "Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!\n",
            "Red Power! \n",
            "Red Power!\n",

            "The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!\n",

            "Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!\n",

            "Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!\n",
            "My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! \n",
            "What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! \n",

            "Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?\n",
            "D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.\n",
            "Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.\n",
            "See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. \n",

Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.\nHand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.\nBlack or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!\nHand in hand, we can live together.\n",

I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold.

            "Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.\n",

            "So... so then, how can you feel bad?\n",
            "...But he's not gonna get in trouble.\n",

            "My consciences just caught up with me.\n",
            "I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.\n",
            "I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.\n",
            "Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-\n",

            "But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.\n",
            "Maaaa. M-maaaa.\n",
            "Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?\n",
            "I'm trying to have a flashback.\n",
            "You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!\n",
            "Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.\n",
            "Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!\n",
            "That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. \n",
            "All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!\n",
            "Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. \n",
            "Benjamin Franklin?\n",
            "Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!\n",
            "Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.\n",
            "Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!\n",
            "I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!\n",
            "Or a really sweet one. \n",
            "Whoa, here it goes! \n",
            "Ohhh awesome!!! \n",
            "Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?\n",
            "Oho yes! I did it I did it!\n",
            "Oho kick fucking ass, dude! \n",
            "No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.\n",
            "Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.\n",
            "Super neato! \n",
            "But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.\n",

            "Everyone, stop! Please! \n",
            "If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.\n",
            "I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called \"having your cake and eating it too.\"\n",
            "The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.\n",
            "Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.\n",

            "Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?\n",

            "Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!\n",
            "Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! \n",
            "Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! \n",
            "Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! \n",
            "No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! \n",
            "Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! \n",
            "Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. \n",
            "I told you, Token.\n",
            "Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.\n",
            "We are going to start... a Christian rock band.\n",
            "Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- \n",
            "Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.\n",
            "All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like \"baby\" and \"Darling\" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.\n",
            "Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.\n",
            "Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! \n",
            "All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. \nI need you in my life, Jesus.\nI can't live without you, Jesus\nAnd I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.\n",
            "Almost there, you guys.\n",
            "Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.\n",
            "I'm going to kill you one day, Token.\n",
            "Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. \n",
            "No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! \n",
            "No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!\n",
            "Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!\n",
            "So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. \nDon't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.\nMy heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.\nI promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.\nJesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.\n",
            "Oh hey guys. How's it going?\n",
            "I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.\n",
            "That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!\n",
            "It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.\n",
            "I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! \n",
            "Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..\n",
            "I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.\n",
            "Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.\n",
            "Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! \n",
            "Who are you?\n",
            "Yeah, you guys are real hard core.\n",
            "Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.\n",
            "Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... \n",
            "You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.\nI love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me\nI'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!\nYou died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?\nWhat's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!\nYour love... is my life! You know when I\u2019m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!\nI wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to\nSave me! Jee...sus...bay-by!\n",
            "Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.\n",
            "Yes, we sure do.\n",
            "Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??\n",
            "Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??\n",
            "I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.\n",
            "Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.\n",
            "Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.\nI wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!\n",
            "The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!\nThe Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!\nYou're one time, two times, three times my Savior...\nWhenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...\n",
            "Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.\n",
            "Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.\n",
            "We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!\n",
            "Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? \n",
            "Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. \n",
            "Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. \n",
            "Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?\n",
            "You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!\n",
            "GOD DAMMIT!! \n",
            "Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!\n",
            "OH, FUCK JESUS!! \n",
            "Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! \n",
            "Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! \n",
            "Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.\n",
            "Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.\n",
            "With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!\n",
            "I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.\n",
            "Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.\n",
            "Calm down! We cannot understand you!\n",
            "Old people!\n",
            "Oh God, they're coming! \n",
            "They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!\n",
            "Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?\n",
            "My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.\n",
            "I believe that's us... thank God. \n",
            "More old people!\n",
            "Old people gone mad!\n",
            "So our only solution is to cut off their life force.\n",
            "No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.\n",
            "Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.\n",
            "Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.\n",
            "I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. \n",
            "Yeah!\n",
            "Aw yeah!\n",
            "Well, right, or we could always do that.\n",
            "Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.\n",
            "Who's joking? \n",
            "You have AIDS?\n",
            "Wow! Casa Bonita?!\n",
            "Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!\n",
            "This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!\n",
            "You... your Mom said you could take three friends.\n",
            "Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?\n",
            "Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!\n",
            "I have never been a dick to you.\n",
            "Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?\n",
            "Okay, except maybe for that one time.\n",
            "Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! \n",
            "Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.\n",
            "Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! \n",
            "Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! \n",
            "No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!\n",
            "Hi Kyle. \n",
            "What isn't it?\n",
            "...I don't understand the difference.\n",
            "Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.\n",
            "Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how \"do\" you act nice to people?\n",
            "Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?\n",
            "Like what?\n",
            "Who's there?\n",
            "Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.\n",
            "Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!\n",
            "Hey Kyle.\n",
            "Well what?\n",
            "I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.\n",
            "So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.\n",
            "I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. \n",
            "I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.\n",
            "Good.\n",
            "Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!\n",
            "Butters, can you keep a secret?\n",
            "For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.\n",
            "A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.\n",
            "Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?\n",
            "Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.\n",
            "Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? \n",
            "Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.\n",
            "I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.\n",
            "According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.\n",
            "No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!\n",
            "Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! \n",
            "Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! \n",
            "All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.\n",
            "No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.\n",
            "I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.\n",
            "Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. \n",
            "Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.\n",
            "Hope you have a good one. See you later. \n",
            "Yes?\n",
            "Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?\n",
            "Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.\n",
            "Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!\n",
            "Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?\n",
            "Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...\n",
            "Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.\n",
            "Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!\n",
            "Butters!\n",
            "Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!\n",
            "The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...\n",
            "There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. \n",
            "No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...\n",
            "We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. \n",
            "Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.\n",
            "Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. \n",
            "What what what?\n",
            "UUuuugh!! \n",
            "Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!\n",
            "The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!\n",
            "They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.\n",
            "We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.\n",
            "Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.\n",
            "Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.\n",
            "All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. \n",
            "Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.\n",
            "We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.\n",
            "Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!\n",
            "It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! \n",
            "We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!\n",
            "Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? \n",
            "Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! \n",
            "The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.\n",
            "We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!\n",
            "Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!\n",
            "Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.\n",
            "I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! \n",
            "Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!\n",
            "We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.\n",
            "\"Pretty cool.\" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.\n",
            "What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.\n",
            "Happy Birthday to you. Happy- \n",
            "We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!\n",
            "But... Casa Bonita.\n",
            "But I...  but...  Stand back!\n",
            "I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! \n",
            "Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!\n",
            "Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! \n",
            "Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!\n",
            "Totally. \n",
            "Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.\n",
            "Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!\n",
            "Go kick his ass, Stan.\n",
            "Will he bleed? That's all we care about.\n",
            "Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?\n",
            "They're just standing there, talking. \n",
            "You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!\n",
            "Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?\n",
            "Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.\n",
            "Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.\n",
            "Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?\n",
            "Oh my God...\n",
            "Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. \n",
            "Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. \n",
            "Oh no! You guys broke up?\n",
            "Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.\n",
            "Damn, that kid is cool, huh?\n",
            "I'm going to kill myself. \n",
            "You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. \n",
            "Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. \n",
            "Nothing.\n",
            "Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. \n",
            "Gross dude! \n",
            "No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.\n",
            "We're sorry.\n",
            "Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?\n",
            "Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!\n",
            "Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.\n",
            "Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?\n",
            "Got it! \n",
            "Isn't he awesome, you guys?\n",
            "Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. \n",
            "Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.\n",
            "Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.\n",
            "Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.\n",
            "Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!\n",
            "Wow, a commercial?\n",
            "God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?\n",
            "So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!\n",
            "Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?\n",
            "Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, \"How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?\" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. \n",
            "Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- \n",
            "Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.\n",
            "Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!\n",
            "Heh, ho-okay. \n",
            "Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??\n",
            "Uh what... what does that mean, \"I'll be dead\"? Hey, uh what, what was that \"dead\" part?\n",
            "Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.\n",
            "I'm not eating the cupcake.\n",
            "Jesus Christ! HAAAA!\n",
            "They're going to kill me! \n",
            "The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!\n",
            "You guys have to help me!\n",
            "Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!\n",
            "If I go, you guys go!\n",
            "Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! \n",
            "Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! \n",
            "You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.\n",
            "I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! \n",
            "Aw awww!\n",
            "Right. What are we playing again?\n",
            "Got it. \n",
            "What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!\n",
            "Yeh-heah, right!\n",
            "What a whore! \n",
            "Come on, Stan, it's first down still. \n",
            "God, what a fag!\n",
            "How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.\n",
            "Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.\n",
            "Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... \n",
            "Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.\n",
            "We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!\n",
            "Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.\n",
            "I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.\n",
            "Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. \n",
            "HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!\n",
            "What?\n",
            "No! No, this can't be happening! \n",
            "You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!\n",
            "Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! \n",
            "It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!\n",
            "This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.\n",
            "You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?\n",
            "Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.\n",
            "We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.\n",
            "Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!\n",
            "You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.\n",
            "Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! \n",
            "Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!\n",
            "Sweet.\n",
            "Look out!\n",
            "Oh Jesus Christ.\n",
            "Which road?!\n",
            "Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. \n",
            "But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.\n",
            "Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!\n",
            "How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.\n",
            "How could you be so stupid!\n",
            "Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! \n",
            "We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.\n",
            "Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! \n",
            "And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. \n",
            "I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.\n",
            "It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.\n",
            "Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! \n",
            "Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!\n"

            "Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.\n",
            "That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.\n",
            "Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.\n",

            "I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!\n",
            "That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.\n",
            "Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!\n",
            "He used to be fat but not no more \n",

            "Sir, we are in business!\n",
            "Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!\n",
            "Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.\n",
            "Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!\n",
            "Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.\n",
            "Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.\n",
            "I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.\n",
            "Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.\n",
            "Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!\n",
            "No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!\n",
            "Check.\n",
            "That should blah  ah- here. \n",

            "Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!\n",
            "Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.\n",
            "Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.\n",
            "Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.\n",
            "Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! \n",
            "Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?\n",
            "Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.\n",
            "Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.\n",
            "Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.\n",

            "Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.\n",
            "There you are, Butters!\n",
            "No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!\n",
            "No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!\n",
            "Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.\n",
            "Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. \n",
            "Butters, it was my pleasure. \n",
            "Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.\n",
            "Look you guys, Butters is asleep.\n",
            "Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... \n",
            "And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.\n",
            "Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh\n",
            "You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!\n",
            "So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.\n",
            "You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?\n",
            "Shh-shh, here he comes.\n",
            "Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!\n",
            "I don't smell anything. Do you guys? \n",
            "Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. \n",
            "His name is Thumper?\n",
            "Ugh, no more., \n",
            "Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. \n",
            "That's awesome, Kenny. \n",
            "Aww, sick dude!\n",
            "Oh YES!! \n",

Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called \"chinballalitis.\"  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?\n",
            "Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!\n",
            "Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!\n",
            "Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "Nice.\n",
            "They look great on you, Butters. They really do.\n",
            "Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. \n",
            "Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. \n",
            "God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?\n",
            "Buh-ters! Buh-ters!\n",
            "Testicles and scrotum! \n",
            "Uh oh, we're losin' him.\n",
            "Oh, that was close.\n",
            "The present.\n",
            "Did he say \"the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world\"?\n",
            "Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!\n",
            "Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin.  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?\n",
            "What's the new topic?\n",
            "Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!\n",
            "Uh, sure!\n",

            "Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?\n",
            "I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?\n",
            "Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.\n",
            "Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.\n",
            "Jeez, that girl is pissed off.\n",
            "But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?\n",
            "Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!\n",

            "Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?\n",
            "Alriiight!\n",
            "No, Uncle Jesse, no!\n",
            "What? What the hell are you guys doing??\n",
            "Where are we going?\n",
            "What? Why?\n",
            "So?\n",
            "Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me \"fatass,\" \"butthole,\" and \"douchebag.\" I really don't feel like you guys's friend. \n",
            "Oho! So you indeed me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!\n",
            "Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. \n",
            "Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.\n",
            "Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.\n",
            "Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.\n",
            "No, it has to be Kyle. \n",
            "Oh man, that was soho awesome!\n",
            "Hell, I'm not goin' with you!\n",
            "Heeeey! \n",
            "Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. \n",
            "You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.\n",
            "Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.\n",
            "O! At least I have as ass, Jew!\n",
            "See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.\n",
            "I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.\n",
            "Eh! \n",
            "Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. \n",
            "Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.\n",
            "I want out.\n",
            "Yeah! Wait-what?\n",
            "Oh, God-damnit you guys.\n",
            "We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!\n",
            "Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.\n",
            "Can't go on. Need... food...\n",
            "There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.\n",
            "All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. \n",
            "Food!\n",
            "Look you guys! Beef jerky!\n",
            "Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.\n",
            "Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?\n",
            "Hippies!\n",
            "What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!\n",
            "Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.\n",
            "Sure, sure.\n",
            "What do you have in mind?\n",
            "Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.\n",
            "All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -\n",
            "We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.\n",
            "Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.\n",
            "Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.\n",
            "Hello.\n",
            "All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. \n",
            "Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! \n",
            "We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! \n",
            "Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! \n",
            "Mike, speak.\n",
            "We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?\n",
            "Good, good.\n",
            "Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.\n",
            "And Worf?\n",
            "Step back! Tell those men to step back!\n",
            "Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as \"Captain.\"\n",
            "No. See, must say, \"Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?\"\n",
            "You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.\n",
            "\"Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!\"\n",
            "Okay, all set!\n",
            "Step on it, Mr. Worf! \n",
            "Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!\n",
            "\"Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?\"\n",
            "Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.\n",
            "Oh, it's a double-cross!!\n",
            "What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!\n",
            "Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!\n",
            "Thank God we stopped it in time.\n",
            "All right!\n",
            "Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?\n",
            "I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!\n",
            "Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? \n",
            "Stan, okay. What's your name? \n",
            "Kyle. What's your name? \n",
            "Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.\n",
            "Amen.\n",
            "What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. \n",
            "Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. \n",
            "Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? \n",
            "Okay, how about ... that? \n",
            "It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!\n",
            "I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.\n",
            "Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!\n",
            "Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.\n",
            "God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? \n",
            "Argh!\n",
            "We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.\n",
            "Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!\n",
            "There, you got it, you got it!\n",
            "Oh, thank God.\n",
            "We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.\n",
            "This TV is great, Chef.\n",
            "Aagh! God-dammit!\n",
            "This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.\n",
            "Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.\n",
            "Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!\n",
            "Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! \n",
            "Here we go!\n",
            "That's it? That's all the commercials?\n",
            "Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!\n",
            "Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!\n",
            "Eewww!\n",
            "God, I hate old people!\n",
            "And my house is being fumigated!\n",
            "Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!\n",
            "Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!\n",
            "The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! \n",
            "These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!\n",
            "You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.\n",
            "Woohoo!!! \n",
            "Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.\n",
            "You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.\n",
            "Yeah, it sure does!\n",
            "I'll do it.\n",
            "Butters, could you take a seat, please?\n",
            "Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.\n",
            "Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and \"filled the gap.\" \n",
            "Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.\n",
            "I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...\n",
            "Lame, yes.\n",
            "Yes, well, we weren't.\n",
            "But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? \n",
            "Who cares?\n",
            "All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?\n",
            "Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.\n",
            "I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. \n",
            "...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. \n",
            "We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...\n",
            "Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. \n",
            "All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?\n",
            "Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?\n",
            "All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! \n",
            "Next?\n",
            "Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.\n",
            "Alrighty then. \n",
            "Uh, what's the question again?\n",
            "Five times one is of course...\n",
            "Five. \n",
            "Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!\n",
            "Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. \n",
            "All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?\n",
            "Just one more rose, Kyle.\n",
            "All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! \n",
            "Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, \"get the fudge out!\" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!\n",
            "The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. \n",
            "Next please.\n",
            "If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?\n",
            "Very nice. \n",
            "You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!\n",
            "All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! \n",
            "Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?\n",
            "I think Towelie is awesome.\n",
            "Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.\n",
            "Token's a smartass.\n",
            "Yeah. Do we really need another one?\n",
            "Oh, thanks Jimmy\n",
            "Alright Jimmy, see ya. \n",
            "Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. \n",
            "Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? \n",
            "You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! \n",
            "Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!\n",
            "No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!\n",
            "Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.\n",
            "Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.\n",
            "Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!\n",
            "If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!\n",
            "Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...\n",
            "Look at me, livin' free\nFree and clean amongst the Sea People\n''We look for pirates and search for gold.\nLife is an adventure with the Sea People\nThey don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.\nThey don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.\nThis is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,\nSea people and me.\nSea people and me, you guys.\n",
            "Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. \n",
            "Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  \"Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly.\"  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?\n",
            "Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go. \n",
            "What the fuck is this?! \n",
            "I got RIPPED OFF! \n",
            "Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep\n",
            "Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!\n",
            "Heheh, okay, okay.\n",
            "Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!\n",
            "Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!\n",
            "Tweek! Where are you going?\n",
            "In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.\n",
            "We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.\n",
            "Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.\n",
            "Ugh.  Just remember the song \"Can't Touch This\" and you'll remember the code word!\n",
            "Is it her?\n",
            "Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...\n",
            "No, just a bunch of goo.\n",
            "There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. \n",
            "It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!\n",
            "Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.\n",
            "G'night, guys.\n",
            "Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. \n",
            "H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!\n",
            "Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! \n",
            "I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.\n",
            "That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!\n",
            "You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.\n",
            "Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.\n",
            "Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?\n",
            "Do you have them or not?\n",
            "What's your name?\n",
            "Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? \n",
            "I see, very interesting. \n",
            "Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.\n",
            "No, gallons.\n",
            "Damint! Give me all you've got, then! \n",
            "That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?\n",
            "And I've got the sea men. \n",
            "Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.\n",
            "Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. \n",
            "Nothin' to do now but wait.\n",
            "Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.\n",
            "Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!\n",
            "Ha ha! \n",
            "Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.\n",
            "Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.\n",
            "I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.\n",
            "What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?\n",
            "...So?\n",
            "Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?\n",
            "Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.\n",
            "That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! \n",
            "Yeah! Go! \n",
            "Oh God-damnit! \n",
            "Oh no! Oh the humanity!\n",
            "Why can't societies just live in peace?\n",
            "I don't know.\n",
            "Ih... in our... butt?\n",
            "Maybe... No.\n",
            "Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?\n",
            "Hm.\n",
            "Aw, dude, I think I might have it.\n",
            "It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?\n",
            "Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?\n",
            "What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.\n",
            "Have you ever tried it?\n",
            "I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!\n",
            "Okay, let's go, Jew! \n",
            "Hold on!  God, let a man crap!\n",
            "I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!\n",
            "I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.\n",
            "Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. \n",
            "Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!\n",
            "Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. \n",
            "It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- \n",
            "You guys! You guys! Look! \n",
            "I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.\n",
            "So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!\n",
            "Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.\n",
            "Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.\n",
            "That's stupid and immature, Cartman!\n",
            "You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!\n",
            "So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. \n",
            "O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?\n",
            "Heh...  what?\n",
            "You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! \n",
            "Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.\n",
            "Yeah, we want our money back!\n",
            "You asshole! \n",
            "Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.\n",
            "Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!\n",
            "Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!\n",
            "Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!\n",
            "Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. \n",
            "Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.\n",
            "Well we can just make them out of paper.\n",
            "It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!\n",
            "Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!\n",
            "How many hats have you made?\n",
            "We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!\n",
            "Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!\n",
            "I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.\n",
            "Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.\n",
            "But just remember that I do all the talking.\n",
            "Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.\n",
            "Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! \n",
            "What could possibly go wrong?\n",
            "...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. \n",
            "Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. \n",
            "Yeah, we're children.\n",
            "Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.\n",
            "Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?\n",
            "Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.\n",
            "He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?\n",
            "Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.\n",
            "People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?\n",
            "Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! \n",
            "Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!\n",
            "Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!\n",
            "Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.\n",
            "You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? \n",
            "Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-\n",
            "...No, he has an icy heart.\n",
            "It's a cool island song.\n",
            "Oh, do we wanna do that?\n",
            "Wow.\n",
            "AY!\n",
            "Man, that new version must have sucked balls.\n",
            "That and youth. Those guys are old.\n",
            "Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.\n",
            "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.\n",
            "Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.\n",
            "It puts the lotion back in the basket!\n",
            "Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!\n",
            "Yes Mom?\n",
            "...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?\n",
            "Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.\n",
            "But I wanna plaaayyy.\n",
            "Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?\n",
            "Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?\n",
            "It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.\n",
            "Yeah, may be.\n",
            "Right, heh.\n",
            "Woohoo.\n",
            "God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.\n",
            "Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! \n",
            "Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk\n",
            "Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.\n",
            "And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.\n",
            "And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.\n",
            "Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.\n",
            "And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. \n",
            "And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.\n",
            "Pleeeeease???\n",
            "Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. \n",
            "Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?\n",
            "That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool. \n",
            "And this is Precious.\n",
            "Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. \n",
            "Now you say, \"It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.\"\n",
            "Heheh, yeah.\n",
            "Now say it again, louder.\n",
            "Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!\n",
            "Now, just yell \"Put the lotion in the fucking basket!\"\n",
            "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, \"Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!\"\n",
            "You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- \n",
            "We're playing \"Lambs.\"\n",
            "Bebe's boobs?\n",
            "So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?\n",
            "What a stupid bitch! \n",
            "One please.\n",
            "Dude, relax.\n",
            "Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?\n",
            "So weak. So weak, dude. Man.\n",
            "At least I'm not a stupid Jew.\n",
            "Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.\n",
            "You bet your fat clown ass it is!\n",
            "...ticket stub?\n",
            "Wu-we don't really \"need\" the ticket stub, do we?\n",
            "GODDAMMIT!!!\n",
            "You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. \n",
            "Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.\n",
            "Kenny!!!\n",
            "Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!\n",
            "What the fuck is closure?!\n",
            "You turned him into a teapot?\n",
            "Wewewewewewe...\n",
            "Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...\n",
            "...Kenny?  Kenny?!\n",
            "What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!\n",
            "God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!\n",
            "Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!\n",
            "Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. \n",
            "Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. \n",
            "What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!\n",
            "How?\n",
            "I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. \n",
            "...No.  Ey! Euuugh.\n",
            "Wha-uh, what?? What?\n",
            "I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.\n",
            "Do you think?\n",
            "Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.\n",
            "Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!\n",
            "Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.\n",
            "Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.\n",
            "You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.\n",
            "Because Jews don't believe in heaven!\n",
            "Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.\n",
            "AH! \n",
            "In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto\n",
            "What did you say?!\n",
            "What did you say?!\n",
            "I said \"Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!\"  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?\n",
            "I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.\n",
            "You're a- stupid Jew.\n",
            "Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.\n",
            "Shut up!\n",
            "Shut up!\n",
            "That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.\n",
            "I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.\n",
            "Looks like I've come to the right place.\n",
            "Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.\n",
            "Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! \n",
            "Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!\n",
            "Eh! \n",
            "Kenny! Kenny! kenny...\n",
            "Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...\n",
            "You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!",
            "The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!\n",
            "You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! \n",
            "I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.\n",
            "I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! \n",
            "Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! \n",
            "Not by giving me brain damage!\n",
            "Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...\n",
            "...I've never heard the words \"only\" and \"candy\" in the same sentence before.\n",
            "No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.\n",
            "Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! \n",
            "Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!\n",
            "It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.\n",
            "Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. \n",
            "And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.\n",
            "Jews can't be Paladins.\n",
            "Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?\n",
            "Man, that's crap.\n",
            "And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.\n",
            "Prepare for battle! \n",
            "This sounds like a really important quest.\n",
            "This... is so cool.\n",
            "Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. \n",
            "And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.\n",
            "Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. \n",
            "You're gay!\n",
            "Yeah!\n",
            "The one tape must be returned!  Run! \n",
            "I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.\n",
            "Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.\n",
            "Open.  Bellog. \n",
            "We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.\n",
            "Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.\n",
            "Clyde's a dick.\n",
            "Kevin, god-damnit..! \n",
            "Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. \n",
            "My God, this thing must really be powerful. \n",
            "Quiet!\n",
            "You're acting like a bunch of assholes!\n",
            "Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.\n",
            "A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!\n",
            "Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--\n",
            "Ha!! Fags! \n",
            "It's Butters.\n",
            "Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. \n",
            "Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.\n",
            "There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! \n",
            "Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!\n",
            "I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!\n",
            "Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!\n",
            "We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what \"lost\" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!\n",
            "If that was possible.\n",
            "We're screwed.\n",
            "The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.\n",
            "And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.\n",
            "Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.\n",
            "No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?\n",
            "Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! \n",
            "No, it was Kenny!\n",
            "Ey!\n",
            "Aw man, this is awesome! \n",
            "I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!\n",
            "Look, a covetous Jew!\n",
            "Ey!\n",
            "I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.\n",
            "Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! \n",
            "I'll take three lunches today, please.\n",
            "It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. \n",
            "Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.\n",
            "Nothing.\n",
            "Yes sir!  Phew. \n",
            "Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! \n",
            "Kenny. Can't have Kenny.\n",
            "Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!\n",
            "Hey you guys! How's it goin'?\n",
            "What the hell are you assholes doing here?!\n",
            "Oh, about a month.\n",
            "He's gone again.\n",
            "Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.\n",
            "Kenny!\n",
            "Thanks, asshole.\n",
            "Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!\n",
            "Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!\n",
            "Oh, good. \n",
            "Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!\n",
            "Right now?\n",
            "Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.\n",
            "Ahh, Aahhhh! \n",
            "Hey, ah I feel a lot better.\n",
            "God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!\n",
            "It's still in baggage claims!\n",
            "Then you throw it away, smartass. \n",
            "Who's this asshole?\n",
            "Then how does he know our names?\n",
            "Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?\n",
            "That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!\n",
            "Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! \n",
            "Yes, come in, please. \n",
            "Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.\n",
            "I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?\n",
            "Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?\n",
            "That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.\n",
            "Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. \n",
            "God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?\n",
            "Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.\n",
            "Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?\n",
            "Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.\n",
            "Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. \n",
            "Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.\n",
            "Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.\n",
            "Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.\n",
            "Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.\n",
            "Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.\n",
            "The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.\n",
            "Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.\n",
            "And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. \n",
            "What?\n",
            "Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.\n",
            "Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog\n",
            "Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?\n",
            "Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?\n",
            "I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.\n",
            "Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!\n",
            "\u00a1La caca de moreno no es aqu\u00ed! \u00a1Aqu\u00ed es verde, se\u00f1or! \u00a1Es verde! \u00a1Arriba arriba!\n",
            "S\u00ed, gracias. \u00bfY t\u00fa?  \u00a1Carlos! \u00a1Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.\n",
            "Marrado. Spectacularrr.\n",
            "God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?\n",
            "Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.\n",
            "Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  \u00a1Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!\n",
            "Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.\n",
            "Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! \u00ad\u00a1Vamonos!\n",
            "Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.\n",
            "Who the hell are you?\n",
            "Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!\n",
            "Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!\n",
            "You're done?\n",
            "Yeah, so how's it look?\n",
            "But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?\n",
            "What?!\n",
            "Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? \n",
            "It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.\n",
            "God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!\n",
            "Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!\n",
            "Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!\n",
            "Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?\n",
            "Jesus Christ!\n",
            "Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! \n",
            "I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.\n",
            "You guys, that's it!\n",
            "Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! \n",
            "...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.\n",
            "They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.\n",
            "Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!\n",
            "The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.\n",
            "Really?\n",
            "Wow!\n",
            "Get the rest of the stuff you guys!\n",
            "You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!\n",
            "Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!\n",
            "Wow, is that where Santa lives?\n",
            "Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?\n",
            "Oh, that's so lame of them. \n",
            "Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.\n",
            "That's what I thought.\n",
            "Hooray!\n",
            "No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.\n",
            "Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!\n",
            "Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!\n",
            "It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.\n",
            "Oh, Christ.\n",
            "Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!\n",
            "Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-\n",

            "Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.\n",

            "Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.\n",

            "Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?\n",
            "Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!\n",
            "Just give me back my money...\n",
            "Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!\n",

            "One please. \n",
            "O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?\n",
            "Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.\n",
            "Racist! \n",

            "Pube fair?\n",
            "Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!\n",
            "Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!\n",
            "Haha, charade you are, Scott! \n",
            "Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! \n",
            "Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!\n",
            "Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.\n",
            "Can you tell me where the pube fair is?\n",
            "Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.\n",
            "No- no such thing?\n",
            "I'm Eric Cartman!\n",
            "Aaah!!!\n",
            "A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here\n",
            "Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.\n",
            "Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...\n",
            "Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.\n",
            "Yeah. Poor grandma...\n",
            "Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. \n",
            "Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! \n",
            "What?\n",
            "Huh?\n",
            "Why??\n",
            "Please Scott give me my money.\n",
            "I beg you to give me back my money.\n",
            "What?!\n",
            "I'm a little piggy.\n",
            "Here's my snout.\n",
            "Oink oink oink.\n",
            "I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.\nOink oink oink, oink oink oink.\nI'm a little piggy; here's\n- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!\n",
            "What- What are you doing??  No!.. wuh...why?\n",
            "Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!\n",
            "Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!\n",
            "Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!\n",
            "Did you guys see that movie \"Hannibal\"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!\n",
            "What?\n",
            "Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, \"It's not your problem.\" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, \"You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!\"  Now who's with me?!! \n",
            "Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!\n",
            "There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.\n",
            "No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. \n",
            "He said it was okay.\n",
            "Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!\n",
            "Not like that, pony! \n",
            "Whattayou mean?\n",
            "How do I do that?\n",
            "I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!\n",
            "Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!\n",
            "You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...\n",
            "So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.\n",
            "Whoa!\n",
            "I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.\n",
            "Radiohead. Yes, of course. \n",
            "Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?\n",
            "Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there!\n",
            "You're welcome, Scott. \n",
            "Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? \n",
            "That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?\n",
            "Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? \n",
            "Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!\n",
            "Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! \n",
            "'\"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.\"' \n",
            "That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!\n",
            "Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! \n",
            "Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!\n",
            "How to get Scott Tenorman back!\n",
            "I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. \n",
            "It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?\n",
            "So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman \u2014 and \u2014 see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! \n",
            "Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! \n",
            "...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!! \n",
            "Hello, Scott!\n",
            "I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!\n",
            "Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!\n",
            "Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.\n",
            "A little penis-biting, perhaps?\n",
            "Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?\n",
            "Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. \n",
            "Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!\n",
            "Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!\n",
            "What's so funny?\n",
            "Not yet, but they will be.\n",
            "Hey, Chef.\n",
            "What contest?\n",
            "Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.\n",
            "Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! \n",
            "Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!\n",
            "Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.\n",
            "Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!\n",
            "Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. \n",
            "Alright.  Hey, this is great! \n",
            "Gawh, this is really good, Scott!\n",
            "What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? \n",
            "Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. \n",
            "I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, \"Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.\"\n",
            "Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! \n",
            "Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.\n",
            "Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! \n",
            "Whoa, bummer, dude.\n",
            "Are you sure? I haven't seen it.\n",
            "You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!\n",
            "Awesome! Give me mine! \n",
            "Well yeah, dude.\n",
            "Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!\n",
            "I think this new guy's funny.\n",
            "Aw, dude, gay!\n",
            "Racist! \n",
            "Don't talk to us, kid.\n",
            "Kenny's a random slut. \n",
            "Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! \n",
            "Weak.\n",
            "Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!\n",
            "Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.\n",
            "We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.\n",
            "Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!\n",
            "Alright!\n",
            "Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!\n",
            "Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.\n",
            "Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?\n",
            "God! She didn't take this long to die.\n",
            "Great. Now can we go?\n",
            "Ogh! God-damnit..!\n",
            "Mom, I wanna go home!\n",
            "Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...\n",
            "Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!\n",
            "Hoosajiggawha?\n",
            "Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?\n",
            "No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...\n",
            "Egh... \n",
            "Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.\n",
            "I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.\n",
            "On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...\n",
            "Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.\n",
            "Huh, I think God has plenty of money.\n",
            "Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. \n",
            "Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.\n",
            "HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!\n",
            "Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!\n",
            "My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.\n",
            "What?!\n",
            "Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.\n",
            "No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.\n",
            "Gentlemen, I thank you.\n",
            "Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa!

            "Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in!

Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.\n",

            "That's right! You stay out!\n",
            "...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!\n",
            "Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.\n",
            "But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.\n",
            "Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.\n",
            "But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.\n",
            "Ugh... Two people?\n",
            "Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...\n",
            "Sweet.\n",
            "Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. \n",
            "I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.\n",
            "The rest of you will just have to try another day.\n",
            "'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.\n",
            "...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?\n",
            "Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? \n",
            "Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security!\n",
            "Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.\n",
            "But I don't know how it works.\n",
            "Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.\n",
            "Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go. \n",
            "Wait a minute! Who are you?\n",
            "HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!\n",
            "I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!\n",
            "Get him out of here! \n",
            "Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....\n",
            "...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! \n",
            "Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me! \n",
            "AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!\n",
            "Hey, there you are! \n",
            "Just give me my money back.\n",
            "I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!\n",
            "You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!\n",
            "GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! \n",
            "GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! \n",
            "Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! \n",
            "Yeah?\n",
            "He-hey, that's my money!\n",
            "What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!\n",
            "Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!\n",
            "No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.\n",
            "But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!\n",
            "This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!\n",
            "It isn't fair!  You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! \n",
            "You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! \n",
            "I'M SO PISSED OFF! \n",
            "Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! \n",
            "Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!\n",
            "It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! \n",
            "Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!\n",
            "No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! \n",

            "I told you guys.\n",
            "Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.\n",
            "That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?\n",
            "Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it\u2014hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! \n",

            "Do you feel protected?\n",
            "Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. \n",
            "I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.\n",
            "So I don't get AIDS.\n",

            "Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!\n",
            "That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.\n",
            "Yes, but they're sand monkeys!\n",

            "Dude, don't call me a Canadian! \n",
            "Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-\n",
            "Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.\n",
            "I'm gonna go take care of this prick!\n",

            "Come on! The cameras are ready!  Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras.  Oh, and here's your microphone. \n",
            "Yeah. \n",
            "You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!\n",
            "Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here! \n",
            "Yes it is! \n",

            "No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! \n",
            "Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. \n",

            "I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.\n",
            "It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?\n",
            "Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?\n",
            "Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.\n",
            "You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.\n",
            "So does that mean I'll never laugh again?\n",
            "Ugh.\n",
            "Oh, dude, oh.\n",
            "Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-\n",

            "Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.\n",

            "Okay, let me have it.\n",
            "Okay, why?\n",
            "...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.\n",

            "...naw, that didn't work either.\n",
            "Who's there?\n",
            "An interrupting cow who\n",
            "Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.\n",
            "And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.\n",
            "Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.\nEric.\n",
            "What's goin' on?\n",
            "Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.\n",
            "Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! \n",
            "A-heh, what?\n",

            "Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! \n",
            "What's that thing?\n",
            "What?\n",
            "Forty bucks?\n",
            "Alright, alright.\n",
            "Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?\n",
            "Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.\n",
            "...Oh, man.\n",
            "Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. \n",
            "Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.\n",
            "I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!\n",
            "Ugh, ugh!\n",
            "Oh!\n",
            "Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!\n",
            "Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.\n",
            "Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.\n",
            "No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, \"Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?\" And I was all like, \"No way!\" And this little light went on in my head like, \"Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin.\" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? \n",
            "Goddamnit, give me another chance!\n",
            "Haha,  serves you right, asshole. \n",
            "He's faaahn.\n",
            "1, 2, 3, 4...\n",
            "He's faaahn.\n",
            "Heheheheheh. \n",
            "I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.\n",
            "...Good job, Jew!\n",
            "Stand by, please.\n",
            "Oh, god dammit!\n",
            "Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.\n",
            "Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!\n",
            "I'll make you eat your parents!\n",
            "Nothing! \n",
            "Aw, that is such bullcrap!\n",
            "No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!\n",
            "Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!\n",
            "Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!\n",
            "All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! \n",
            "Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.\n",
            "Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.\n",
            "Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. \n",

            "Well, let's just play our game, then.\n",
            "Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! \n",
            "Kick his nutsack! \n",
            "Uh huh.\n",
            "Yeah.\n",

            "Stem cells, numbnuts!\n",
            "It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.\n",
            "Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!\n",
            "Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.\nBosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. \nOh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. \nI gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what?

I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.\nYes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. \n",

            "Not at all, but go on. \n",
            "My God...\n",
            "So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.\n",
            "Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!\n",

He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song \nIt was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant\nThe heat of the moment shone in your eyes\nI never meant to be so bad to you\nOne thing I said that I would never do\n",

Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? \n",
            "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.\n",

I'm eight and a half inches.\" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.

It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! \n",

            "Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. \n",

            "Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.\n",
            "What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.\n",

            "Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!\n",

            "Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.\n",
            "You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.\n",
            "No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!\n",

            "It's okay, I'm here.\n",
            "Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.\n",
            "That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.\n",
            "The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.\n",
            "Mmmm.\n",
            "You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?\n",

            "Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.\n",

            "Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... \n",
            "'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.\n",

            "Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.\n",
            "I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', \"Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!\"\n",
            "Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. \n",

            "Jesus was made of crackers?\n",
            "So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.\n",
            "Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! \n",

            "Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.\n",
            "How was it?\n",
            "Huh?\n",
            "Who's in there?\n",
            "Well, here goes everything. \n",
            "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.\n",
            "Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...\n",
            "And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?\n",
            "Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.\n",
            "No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. \n",
            "Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!\n",
            "Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.\n",
            "I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.\n",
            "Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!\n",
            "Turn around so I can clean out your ass.\n",
            "What?\n",
            "Oh, now you've said it, too!\n",
            "Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.\n",
            "Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! \n",
            "And he never took Communion!\n",
            "Yeah. \n",
            "Come on, hurry up! \n",
            "What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!\n",
            "I'm first, I'm first! \n",
            "What the? \n",
            "You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!\n",
            "Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!\n",
            "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!\n",
            "We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-\n",
            "There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!\n",
            "It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!\n",
            "Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!\n",
            "I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! \n",
            "Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?\n",
            "Praise God-uh!\n",
            "This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.\n",
            "Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. \n",
            "No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!\n",
            "This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!\n",
            "Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?\n",
            "Oh my God!!\n",
            "It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!\n",
            "Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!\n",
            "Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.\n",
            "He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!\n",
            "And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!\n",
            "We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! \n",
            "Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!\n",
            "The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!\n",
            "Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.\n",
            "Let's see... Matthew 15:11. \"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man.\" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. \n",
            "Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. \n",
            "Sister, have you read this book?\n",
            "Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.\n",
            "Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?\n",
            "We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! \n",
            "Well...\n",
            "Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?\n",
            "Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!\n",
            "That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!\n",
            "Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?\n",
            "Praise the Lord-uh!\n",
            "For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!\n",
            "We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!\n",
            "Devil be  gone-uh!\n",
            "Now walk, Timmih! \n",
            "Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!\n",
            "The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! \n",
            "He walks-uh!\n",

            "And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?\n",

            "For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!\n",
            "He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!\n",
            "Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say \"Amen!\"\n",
            "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! \n",
            "Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!\n",
            "Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!\n",
            "Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.\n",
            "It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.\n",
            "Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.\n",
            "My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!\n",
            "Suck my balls!\n",
            "Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! \n",

            "Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.\n",
            "Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.\nRemember how it used to be in the Third Grade?\nWe used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade\nWe learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice\nSat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles\nThe world seemed to all make sense\nbut that sense seems to slowly fade\nAfter Third Grade\nIn the Third Grade we used to write with crayons\nWe would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue\nWe had warm cookies and hearts full of love\nAnd there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...\nThere's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute\nTo Third Grade\n",
            "I wish I was still there.\n",
            "Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.\n",
            "Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!\n",
            "Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.\n",
            "Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-\n",
            "We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!\n",

            "We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! \n",
            "You're damn right they do!\n",
            "Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?\n",

            "Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? \n",

            "...What?\n",
            "Touch\u00e9, teacher. Touch\u00e9.\n",
            "What??\n",
            "Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.\n",
            "Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.\n",
            "He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.\n",
            "Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. \n",
            "Yeah, that's me.\n",

            "Well...  \"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!\"\n",
            "Here, Kyle. \n",
            "And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?\n",
            "Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.\n",
            "And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.\n",
            "Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.\n",
            "Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.\n",
            "Hold it.\n",
            "I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.\n",
            "Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.\n",

            "Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.\n",
            "You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?\n",
            "What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!\n",
            "Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! \n",
            "Hey, dudes.\n",
            "Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.\n",
            "Why the hell not?!\n",
            "Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!\n",
            "But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.\n",
            "Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. \n",
            "Ech! Screw you guys. Home. \n",

            "Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.\n",
            "That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!\n",

            "Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to \"Phantom Of The Opera\"?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!\n",

            "No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!\n",
            "No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.\n",

            "Dude, we need your turkey for our play!\n",
            "I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?\n",
            "I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.\n",
            "Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.\n",
            "Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. \n",
            "Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. \n",
            "Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!\n",
            "Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us! \n",

            "Oh, man!\n",
            "No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.\n",
            "Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!\n",
            "Alright everybody, let's take our places!\n",
            "I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.\n",
            "Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.\n",

            "Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.\n",
            "Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.\n",
            "I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.\n",
            "No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.\n",
            "You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.\n",

            "Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!\n",
            "Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.\n",
            "Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.\n",
            "Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.\n",
            "Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?\n",
            "After Red Racer, of course.\n",
            "However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.\n",
            "Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.\n",

            "You just hit each other, smack each other around. \n",
            "I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.\n",
            "Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!\n",
            "Fine! \n",

Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.\n",

I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee\n",

            "Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.\n",

            "Let me see! \n",
            "Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?\n",
            "Thanks to Kyle's mother.\n",

            "Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.\n",
            "Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. \n",
            "Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!\n",
            "Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!\n",
