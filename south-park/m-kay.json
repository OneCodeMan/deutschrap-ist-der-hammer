But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show, the John Schneider Variety Hour , was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie , they were enraged, bewildered, and scared.  The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others.  The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish.  Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars.
